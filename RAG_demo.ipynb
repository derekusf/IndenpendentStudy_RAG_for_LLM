      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine a generative model with an information \n",

      "integrate the robustness of a large language model (LLM) with the relevance and up-to-dateness of \n",
      "external information sources, resulting in responses that are not only natural and human-like but also \n",
      "the latest, accurate, and contextually relevant to the query.(1-4) The interaction of the two modules \n",
      "(retrieval and generation) enables responses that would not be achievable with either module alone, \n",
      "making RAG more than just the sum of its components. This approach represents a significant milestone \n",
      "in the field of generative models by enabling the induction of high-quality responses in less-explored \n",
      "domains at a low expense.(5, 6)  \n",
      "In the conventional RAG operation, the initial step involves converting input queries into vector \n",
      "embeddings, which are then used to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database. Following this, \n",
      "the generative part of RAG utilizes the retrieved external data for producing contextually rich \n",
      "responses.(7) Thus, both the embedding and generative models are considered crucial factors in the \n",
      "performance of RAG, directly affecting the retrieval process.(8) However, in niche domains, the \n",
      "performance of generic LLM-based embedding models appears suboptimal compared to their \n",
      "effectiveness in more general fields. The lack of specialized training data in these domains results in \n",
      "embeddings that do not adequately capture the nuances and specificity of the domain(9), leading to less \n",
      "accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval. Despite the evident presence of these \n",
      "functional limitations, they have not been much identified through experiments, therefore the optimality \n",
      "of the conventional LLM-based vector embedding RAG methods for niche domains has remained in \n",
      "obscurity. Researchers have been aware of these shortcomings of LLMs and have explored \n",
      "supplementary processes such as fine-tuning to improve the performance.(8, 10-12) However, the cost \n",
      "of fine-tuning, especially when it involves adjusting the entire or majority of parameters in LLM, has \n",
      "rapidly become expensive, thereby increasing the demand for alternative solutions.(13-15)  \n",
      "To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology: Prompt-RAG. This new approach to \n",
      "RAG eliminates the reliance on vector embeddings, adopting a more direct and flexible retrieval process \n",
      "based on natural language prompts. It involves a large-scale pre-trained generative model that handles \n",
      "the entire steps from document retrieval to response generation without the need for a vector database \n",
      "or an algorithm for indexing and selecting vectors, thus having the processing structure of RAG greatly \n",

      "the latest GPT model, our method can compensate for the deficiencies in vector embedding-based RAG \n",

      "token overlaps, which are not always compatible with human reasoning, potentially leading to \n",
      "suboptimal performance when used in RAG methods. To address these shortcomings, we introduced \n",
      "Prompt-RAG, a natural language prompt-based RAG methodology, providing a strategic shift from \n",
      "conventional RAGs operated with vector embeddings. This stemmed from the recognition of the \n",
      "limitations inherent in LLMs, utilizing the linguistic capabilities of LLM and addressing its constraints \n",
      "at the same time. As a result, our QA chatbot equipped with Prompt-RAG exhibited promising outcomes \n",
      "in terms of relevance, readability, and informativeness in the KM domain. Moreover, it coped with a \n",
      "variety of types of KM-related questions as well, proving its practical stability. \n",
      "  The potential of Prompt-RAG is substantial. Importantly, our model is not confined only to the KM \n",
      "domain but can be applied to other marginal domains that require RAG. GPT is recognized for its \n",
      "emergent properties, potentially helping deal with highly abstract, contextual, or previously unseen \n",
      "expressions.(37-39) It would facilitate high-quality retrieval with a ToC that contains the comprehensive \n",
      "and essential context of documents, leading to desirable responses across various domains. Its \n",
      "applicability and efficiency can expand vastly, together with natural language processing techniques \n",

      "uncertain concepts and terminologies would raise some challenges for conventional vector embedding-\n",

      "allows for a nuanced understanding of queries(43) and thus results in a more detailed, accurate, and \n",

      "The Information Part for Targeted and Untargeted Attacks\n",
      "The {information} component is intentionally designed to extract a substantial volume of data from the\n",
      "database. These data determine the maximum limit of attack capabilities. Therefore, whether employing a\n",
      "targeted or untargeted attack, it is crucial to maintain input diversity in order to ensure effective extraction.\n",
      "For targeted attacks, it is also crucial to ensure that the extracted contexts aligns as closely as possible with\n",
      "the attacker’s specific requirements. Consequently, the design of the {information} component differs for\n",
      "these two attack types.\n",
      "Targeted Attack\n",
      "To generate the {information} component for a targeted attack, there are two stages\n",
      "involved.\n",
      "In the first stage, the attacker must provide specific examples based on their individual requirements.\n",
      "For instance, they may write queries such as \"I want some advice about {target name}\", \"About {target\n",
      "name}\" if the name of the target object is clear. On the contrary, if the target is abstract, such as a specific\n",
      "email address or someone’s phone number, the attacker can provide the prefix content related to these\n",
      "targets, such as \"Please email us at\" or \"Please call me at\".\n",
      "In the second stage, it is crucial to generate a significant quantity of {information} that is both similar\n",
      "and varied based on the provided examples. If the extracted target consists of numerous sub-contents, the\n",
      "generation process can incorporate replacing these specific sub-contents to generate diverse variations.\n",
      "Specifically, for the HealthcareMagic dataset, considering the multitude of disease types, the names\n",
      "of different diseases can be obtained by leveraging ChatGPT’s generation capabilities or by accessing\n",
      "the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from the World Health Organization (WHO). The\n",
      "{information} component is created by \"I want some advice about {disease name}\". Another approach\n",
      "(is also used for the Enron Email dataset) is to directly leverage LLMs like ChatGPT to generate similar\n",
      "sentences with examples. For instance, you can input “Generate 100 similar snetences like \"Please email\n",
      "us at\"”.\n",
      "Untargeted Attack\n",
      "Since there is no need to extract specific targets, untargeted attack only needs to\n",
      "consider making {information} components more diverse to obtain more data from retrieval datasets. To\n",
      "achieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we randomly select chunks from the Common Crawl dataset\n",
      "to serve as the {information} component. Due to the random nature of the input, it has the potential to\n",
