      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine a generative model with an information \n",
      "retrieval function, designed to overcome the inherent constraints of generative models.(1) They \n",
      "integrate the robustness of a large language model (LLM) with the relevance and up-to-dateness of \n",
      "external information sources, resulting in responses that are not only natural and human-like but also \n",
      "the latest, accurate, and contextually relevant to the query.(1-4) The interaction of the two modules \n",
      "(retrieval and generation) enables responses that would not be achievable with either module alone, \n",
      "making RAG more than just the sum of its components. This approach represents a significant milestone \n",
      "in the field of generative models by enabling the induction of high-quality responses in less-explored \n",
      "domains at a low expense.(5, 6)  \n",
      "In the conventional RAG operation, the initial step involves converting input queries into vector \n",
      "embeddings, which are then used to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database. Following this, \n",
      "the generative part of RAG utilizes the retrieved external data for producing contextually rich \n",
      "responses.(7) Thus, both the embedding and generative models are considered crucial factors in the \n",
      "performance of RAG, directly affecting the retrieval process.(8) However, in niche domains, the \n",
      "performance of generic LLM-based embedding models appears suboptimal compared to their \n",
      "effectiveness in more general fields. The lack of specialized training data in these domains results in \n",
      "embeddings that do not adequately capture the nuances and specificity of the domain(9), leading to less \n",
      "accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval. Despite the evident presence of these \n",
      "functional limitations, they have not been much identified through experiments, therefore the optimality \n",
      "of the conventional LLM-based vector embedding RAG methods for niche domains has remained in \n",
      "obscurity. Researchers have been aware of these shortcomings of LLMs and have explored \n",
      "supplementary processes such as fine-tuning to improve the performance.(8, 10-12) However, the cost \n",
      "of fine-tuning, especially when it involves adjusting the entire or majority of parameters in LLM, has \n",
      "rapidly become expensive, thereby increasing the demand for alternative solutions.(13-15)  \n",
      "To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology: Prompt-RAG. This new approach to \n",
      "RAG eliminates the reliance on vector embeddings, adopting a more direct and flexible retrieval process \n",
      "based on natural language prompts. It involves a large-scale pre-trained generative model that handles \n",
      "the entire steps from document retrieval to response generation without the need for a vector database \n",
      "or an algorithm for indexing and selecting vectors, thus having the processing structure of RAG greatly \n",
      "simplified. Therefore, it not only takes advantage of the RAG’s strength but also circumvents the \n",
      "limitations of conventional vector embedding-based methodology. Prompt-RAG is based on \n",
      "maximizing the use of the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs. Especially using \n",
      "the latest GPT model, our method can compensate for the deficiencies in vector embedding-based RAG \n",
      "arising from the shortage of domain-specific knowledge. \n",
      "To examine the utility of Prompt-RAG in practice, we conducted two exemplary studies focusing on \n",
      "the Korean Medicine (KM) domain. KM, a branch of traditional East Asian medicine, has diverged \n",
      "from traditional Chinese medicine and Japanese Kampo medicine in aspects like physiological theories, \n",
      "treatments, and Sasang constitutional medicine.(16, 17) It was reported that GPT models have achieved \n",
      "excellent results in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)(18-20), while \n",

      "reached the passing threshold, underperforming in subjects unique to KM, especially Sasang \n",
      "constitutional medicine and public health & medicine-related law.(21) In this niche area, rich in \n",
      "specialized knowledge and distinct from Conventional Medicine (CM), we first demonstrated the \n",
      "functional suboptimality of LLM-based vector embeddings. Subsequently, we demonstrated Prompt-\n",
      "RAG's effectiveness in this context. A Question-Answering (QA) chatbot based on Prompt-RAG was \n",

      "and conventional vector embedding-based RAG models. This study not only highlights the challenges \n",

      "In this study, we introduce Prompt-RAG, a novel approach distinct from the conventional vector \n",
      "embedding-based RAG. Prompt-RAG consists of three steps: preprocessing, heading selection, and \n",
      "retrieval-augmented generation. The overall scheme of Prompt-RAG might seem similar to that of \n",
      "conventional RAG methods. However, details in each step are quite distinguishable especially in that \n",
      "conventional RAGs rely on a complex multi-step process involving the vectorization of documents and \n",
      "algorithmic retrieval from a vector database for a generative model's response. The workflows of vector \n",
      "embedding-based RAG and our method are depicted in Figure 1. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure. 1. Comparative workflows of two RAG models. (A) depicts the vector embedding-based RAG \n",
      "process. Relevant pieces of information are retrieved from a database of document embeddings through \n",
      "algorithms. The retrieved data are augmented in a generative model to produce a response. (B) illustrates \n",
      "the process of Prompt-RAG. An LLM-based generative model directly uses a table of contents for \n",
      "constructing a contextual reference, followed by generating a response with it. \n",
      "Abbreviation: RAG, Retrieval-augmented generation; LLM, Large-language model. \n",
      " \n",
      "1) Preprocessing \n",
      "Prompt-RAG initiates by extracting or creating a Table of Contents (ToC) from a user’s document(s), \n",
      "which is the main subject of the retrieval. The procedure can be done flexibly depending on the type of \n",
      "document and the user's preferences. One of the most ideal cases is that a ToC is already prepared, made \n",
      "by the author(s) of the document. And yet, even in the absence of a pre-determined ToC, it can be \n",
      "arbitrarily generated, for example, using a generative model or in a manual way, based on the \n",
      "document's quantitative, semantic, or individual divisions. It should be noted that the size of a ToC must \n",
      "not exceed the context window size of the generative model for heading selection. Consequently, some \n",
      "headings or details of the ToC (e.g., heading or page numbers, or hierarchical structure) might need to \n",
      "be removed in order to reduce the number of tokens. The body of the document should then be divided \n",
      "\n",
      "5 \n",
      "into sections according to the headings and prepared for subsequent retrieval. \n",
      " \n",
      "2) Heading selection \n",
      "A prompt, which contains both a query and a ToC, is passed to an LLM-based generative model and \n",
      "the model is asked to autonomously select the headings most pertinent to the query or those that help \n",
      "the most to find information concerning the query. Multiple heading selections can be performed using \n",
      "the hierarchical structure of the headings, narrowing down from main headings to subheadings if a user \n",
      "wants to make use of all the headings from an oversized ToC. As this procedure is a preliminary step \n",
      "for making a reference for answer generation, the number of selected headings can be set in the prompt \n",
      "in advance depending on the budget and the context window size of the generative model for answer \n",
      "generation. It is recommended that the model produce a response in a structured format during heading \n",
      "selection to optimize efficiency for the following retrieval process as well as token usage.  \n",
      " \n",
      "3) Retrieval-augmented generation \n",
      "Sections of the document under the selected headings are retrieved and concatenated as a reference \n",
      "for answer generation. Again, it should be noted that the size of a reference must be smaller than the \n",
      "context window size of the generative model for answer generation. Therefore, the size of a reference \n",
      "has to be reduced by truncation or summarization when overly large. After a reference is prepared, a \n",
      "prompt including both the query and the reference is forwarded into a generative model. In response, \n",
      "the model consults the augmentations to generate a response to the query. \n",

      "1) Comparative exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings in the KM and CM domains. \n",
      "This experiment aimed to identify and exemplify the relative representational defects of LLM-based \n",
      "vector embedding in niche domains compared to other well-established domains. To explain this point, \n",
      "we conducted a comparative analysis with vector embeddings from documents in KM and CM domains.  \n",
      "For this experiment, we selected 10 documents each from KM and CM domains, specifically \n",
      "regarding their physiological contents. ‘Eastern Medicine Physiology'(22) served as the document pool \n",
      "for KM. This book, compiled in Korean, has been revised by professors from every Korean Medicine \n",
      "college in South Korea and is used as the principal textbook in the physiology curriculum. On the other \n",
      "hand, ‘Physiology'(23) was chosen for the CM domain. To investigate the impact of language on \n",
      "representational differences in embeddings, we collected documents with the exactly identical contents \n",
      "from both the English version and the Korean-translated version of ‘Physiology'. The titles of the \n",
      "selected documents from each domain are listed in Appendix Table 1. We extracted the embedding \n",
      "vectors for a total of 30 documents – 10 each from KM physiology, CM physiology in Korean (CM_KR), \n",
      "and CM physiology in English (CM_EN) – using E5-mistral-7b-instruct(24), Voyage AI’s voyage-02, \n",
      "and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 models to figure out LLMs' representations of KM and CM \n",
      "knowledge. \n",
      "Our analysis focused on identifying patterns of the KM and the CM domain embeddings with three \n",
      "key document similarity metrics: human-evaluated document relatedness, embedding correlation \n",
      "coefficients, and token overlap coefficients. We assessed whether the correlation coefficients between \n",
      "embedding pairs closely align with the human-evaluated ground truth or merely follow the surface-\n",
      "level similarity (token overlap) by conducting the correlation analyses across these metrics. It allows us \n",
      "to understand the depth of embedding representations and their correlation with human-perceived \n",
      "document pairwise relevance. \n",
      "For this, the Pearson correlation coefficients(25) were calculated for every embedding vector pair, \n",
      "covering 45 pairs in each of the three categories (KM, CM_KR, CM_EN). To assess explicit similarity \n",
      "in a document pair, we computed the overlap coefficient(26) for tokens in KM, CM_KR, CM_EN \n",
      "documents. The token overlap coefficient was calculated as:  \n",

      "ada-002. Repeated appearances of a single token in a document were counted and considered separately. \n",
      "To determine the ground truth of document pair correlations within each domain, two KM doctors \n",
      "with national licenses evaluated the relatedness between each pair of the KM and CM documents. A \n",
      "binary scoring system was adopted: a score of 1 indicated that a pair was interrelated, and 0 for unrelated \n",
      "\n",
      "7 \n",
      "documents. The human-evaluated document relatedness scores were then obtained by averaging the \n",
      "two doctors' scores in KM and CM documents, respectively.  \n",

      "(1) Chatbot Settings \n",
      "For the evaluation, we developed a domain-specific, prompt-RAG-based chatbot for the book \n",

      "The original ToC of the book had already been defined by the authors. Subheadings were added to it, \n",
      "aligning with the book’s actual sections. The expanded table of contents exceeded the context window \n",
      "size for heading selection, so some headings were removed to handle this issue. The body of the book \n",
      "was then segmented according to the modified headings for the subsequent retrieval. \n",
      "We passed a model based on GPT-4 a prompt containing both the revised ToC and a query, asking \n",
      "the model to identify five pertinent headings from the ToC. At the same time, it was instructed to avoid \n",

      "In the first stage, the attacker must provide specific examples based on their individual requirements.\n",
      "For instance, they may write queries such as \"I want some advice about {target name}\", \"About {target\n",
      "name}\" if the name of the target object is clear. On the contrary, if the target is abstract, such as a specific\n",
      "email address or someone’s phone number, the attacker can provide the prefix content related to these\n",
      "targets, such as \"Please email us at\" or \"Please call me at\".\n",
      "In the second stage, it is crucial to generate a significant quantity of {information} that is both similar\n",
      "and varied based on the provided examples. If the extracted target consists of numerous sub-contents, the\n",
      "generation process can incorporate replacing these specific sub-contents to generate diverse variations.\n",
      "Specifically, for the HealthcareMagic dataset, considering the multitude of disease types, the names\n",

(section 6) We present the lessons learned from three\\ncase studies involving the implementation of a RAG system.\\nThis presents the challenges faced and insights gained.\\nContributions arising from this work include:\\n• A catalogue of failure points (FP) that occur in RAG systems.\\n• An experience report from 3 case studies of implementing a\\nRAG system. Two currently running at Deakin University.\\n• A research direction for RAG systems based on the lessons\\nlearned from the 3 case studies.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nRetrieval augmented generation encompasses using documents\\nto augment large language models through pre-training and at\\ninference time [7, 9, 12]. Due to the compute cost, data preparation\\ntime and required resources using RAG without training or fine-\\ntuning is an attractive proposition. However, challenges arise when\\nusing large language models for information extraction such as\\nperformance with long text [8].\\nA recent survey [19] showed that large language models are\\nused across the RAG pipeline including retriever, data generation,\\nrewriter, and reader. Our work complements this survey by taking\\na software engineering perspective to shine a light on what issues\\nengineers will face and what software engineering research is nec-\\nessary to realise solutions with the current state-of-the-art RAG\\nsystems.\\nEmerging work has looked at benchmarking RAG systems [3]\\nbut not at the failures occurring during implementation. Software\\nengineering research has investigated the use of RAG systems for\\ncode-related tasks [15]. However, the application of RAG systems\\nis broader than software engineering tasks. This paper comple-\\nments existing work by presenting challenges faced during the\\nimplementation of a RAG system with a focus on practitioners.\\nErrors and failures that arise from RAG systems overlap with\\nother information retrieval systems including 1) no metrics for\\nquery rewriting, 2) document re-ranking, and 3) effective content\\nsummarisation [19]. Our results confirm this The unique aspects\\nare related to the semantic and generative nature of the use of large\\nlanguage models including evaluating factual accuracy [16].\\n3\\nRETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION\\nWith the explosion in popularity of large language model services\\nsuch as ChatGPT2, Claude3, and Bard 4, people have explored their\\nuse as a question and answering systems. While the performance\\nis impressive [16] there are two fundamental challenges: 1) hallu-\\ncinations - where the LLM produces a response that looks right\\n1https://github.com/openai/evals\\n2https://chat.openai.com/\\n3https://claude.ai/\\n4https://bard.google.com/\\nbut is incorrect, and 2) unbounded - no way to direct or update\\nthe content of the output (other than through prompt engineering).\\nA RAG system is an information retrieval approach designed to\\novercome the limitations of using a LLM directly.\\nRAG works by taking a natural language query is converted into\\nan embedding which is used to semantically search a set of docu-\\nments. Retrieved documents are then passed to a large language\\nmodel to generate an answer. An overview of a RAG system is\\nshown in Figure 1 as two separate processes, Index and Query. See\\nthis survey for more details [19]\\n3.1\\nIndex Process\\nIn a RAG system, the retrieval system works using embeddings\\nthat provide a compressed semantic representation of the docu-\\nment. An embedding is expressed as a vector of numbers. During\\nthe Index process each document is split into smaller chunks that\\nare converted into an embedding using an embedding model. The\\noriginal chunk and the embedding are then indexed in a database.\\nSoftware engineers face design decisions around how best to chunk\\nthe document and how large a chunk should be. If chunks are too\\nsmall certain questions cannot be answered, if the chunks are too\\nlong then the answers include generated noise.\\nDifferent types of documents require different chunking and pro-\\ncessing stages. For example, video content requires a transcription\\npipeline to extract the audio and convert to text prior to encoding\\n(see subsection 4.2. The choice of which embedding to use also\\nmatters as changing the embedding strategy requires re-indexing\\nall chunks. An embedding should be chosen based on the ability to\\nsemantically retrieve correct responses. This process depends on\\nthe size of the chunks, the types of questions expected, the structure\\nof the content and the application domain.\\n3.2\\nQuery Process\\nThe Query process takes place at run time. A question expressed\\nas natural language is first converted into a general query. To gen-\\neralise the query a large language model is used which enables\\nadditional context such as previous chat history to be included\\nin the new query. An embedding is then calculated from the new\\nquery to use for locating relevant documents from the database.\\nTop-k similar documents are retrieved using a similarity method\\nsuch as cosine similarity (vector databases have techniques such as\\ninverted indexes to speed up retrieval time). The intuition is that\\nchunks that are semantically close to the query are likely to contain\\nthe answer.\\nRetrieved documents are then re-ranked to maximise the likeli-\\nhood that the chunk with the answer is located near the top. The\\nnext stage is the Consolidator which is responsible for processing\\nthe chunks. This stage is needed to overcome the limitations of\\nlarge language models 1) token limit and 2) rate limit. Services such\\nas OpenAI have hard limits on the amount of text to include in a\\nprompt. This restricts the number of chunks to include in a prompt\\nto extract out an answer and a reduction strategy is needed to chain\\nprompts to obtain an answer. These online services also restrict the\\nnumber of tokens to use within a time frame restricting the latency\\nof a system. Software engineers need to consider these tradeoffs\\nwhen designing a RAG system.\\n')"

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine a generative model with an information \n",
      "retrieval function, designed to overcome the inherent constraints of generative models.(1) They \n",
      "integrate the robustness of a large language model (LLM) with the relevance and up-to-dateness of \n",
      "external information sources, resulting in responses that are not only natural and human-like but also \n",
      "the latest, accurate, and contextually relevant to the query.(1-4) The interaction of the two modules \n",
      "(retrieval and generation) enables responses that would not be achievable with either module alone, \n",
      "making RAG more than just the sum of its components. This approach represents a significant milestone \n",
      "in the field of generative models by enabling the induction of high-quality responses in less-explored \n",
      "domains at a low expense.(5, 6)  \n",
      "In the conventional RAG operation, the initial step involves converting input queries into vector \n",
      "embeddings, which are then used to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database. Following this, \n",
      "the generative part of RAG utilizes the retrieved external data for producing contextually rich \n",
      "responses.(7) Thus, both the embedding and generative models are considered crucial factors in the \n",
      "performance of RAG, directly affecting the retrieval process.(8) However, in niche domains, the \n",
      "performance of generic LLM-based embedding models appears suboptimal compared to their \n",
      "effectiveness in more general fields. The lack of specialized training data in these domains results in \n",
      "embeddings that do not adequately capture the nuances and specificity of the domain(9), leading to less \n",
      "accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval. Despite the evident presence of these \n",
      "functional limitations, they have not been much identified through experiments, therefore the optimality \n",
      "of the conventional LLM-based vector embedding RAG methods for niche domains has remained in \n",
      "obscurity. Researchers have been aware of these shortcomings of LLMs and have explored \n",
      "supplementary processes such as fine-tuning to improve the performance.(8, 10-12) However, the cost \n",
      "of fine-tuning, especially when it involves adjusting the entire or majority of parameters in LLM, has \n",
      "rapidly become expensive, thereby increasing the demand for alternative solutions.(13-15)  \n",
      "To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology: Prompt-RAG. This new approach to \n",
      "RAG eliminates the reliance on vector embeddings, adopting a more direct and flexible retrieval process \n",
      "based on natural language prompts. It involves a large-scale pre-trained generative model that handles \n",
      "the entire steps from document retrieval to response generation without the need for a vector database \n",
      "or an algorithm for indexing and selecting vectors, thus having the processing structure of RAG greatly \n",
      "simplified. Therefore, it not only takes advantage of the RAG’s strength but also circumvents the \n",
      "limitations of conventional vector embedding-based methodology. Prompt-RAG is based on \n",
      "maximizing the use of the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs. Especially using \n",
      "the latest GPT model, our method can compensate for the deficiencies in vector embedding-based RAG \n",
      "arising from the shortage of domain-specific knowledge. \n",
      "To examine the utility of Prompt-RAG in practice, we conducted two exemplary studies focusing on \n",
      "the Korean Medicine (KM) domain. KM, a branch of traditional East Asian medicine, has diverged \n",
      "from traditional Chinese medicine and Japanese Kampo medicine in aspects like physiological theories, \n",
      "treatments, and Sasang constitutional medicine.(16, 17) It was reported that GPT models have achieved \n",
      "excellent results in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)(18-20), while \n",

      "reached the passing threshold, underperforming in subjects unique to KM, especially Sasang \n",
      "constitutional medicine and public health & medicine-related law.(21) In this niche area, rich in \n",
      "specialized knowledge and distinct from Conventional Medicine (CM), we first demonstrated the \n",

      "In this study, we introduce Prompt-RAG, a novel approach distinct from the conventional vector \n",
      "embedding-based RAG. Prompt-RAG consists of three steps: preprocessing, heading selection, and \n",
      "retrieval-augmented generation. The overall scheme of Prompt-RAG might seem similar to that of \n",
      "conventional RAG methods. However, details in each step are quite distinguishable especially in that \n",
      "conventional RAGs rely on a complex multi-step process involving the vectorization of documents and \n",
      "algorithmic retrieval from a vector database for a generative model's response. The workflows of vector \n",
      "embedding-based RAG and our method are depicted in Figure 1. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure. 1. Comparative workflows of two RAG models. (A) depicts the vector embedding-based RAG \n",
      "process. Relevant pieces of information are retrieved from a database of document embeddings through \n",
      "algorithms. The retrieved data are augmented in a generative model to produce a response. (B) illustrates \n",
      "the process of Prompt-RAG. An LLM-based generative model directly uses a table of contents for \n",
      "constructing a contextual reference, followed by generating a response with it. \n",
      "Abbreviation: RAG, Retrieval-augmented generation; LLM, Large-language model. \n",
      " \n",
      "1) Preprocessing \n",
      "Prompt-RAG initiates by extracting or creating a Table of Contents (ToC) from a user’s document(s), \n",
      "which is the main subject of the retrieval. The procedure can be done flexibly depending on the type of \n",
      "document and the user's preferences. One of the most ideal cases is that a ToC is already prepared, made \n",
      "by the author(s) of the document. And yet, even in the absence of a pre-determined ToC, it can be \n",
      "arbitrarily generated, for example, using a generative model or in a manual way, based on the \n",
      "document's quantitative, semantic, or individual divisions. It should be noted that the size of a ToC must \n",
      "not exceed the context window size of the generative model for heading selection. Consequently, some \n",
      "headings or details of the ToC (e.g., heading or page numbers, or hierarchical structure) might need to \n",
      "be removed in order to reduce the number of tokens. The body of the document should then be divided \n",
      "\n",
      "11, 5 \n",
      "into sections according to the headings and prepared for subsequent retrieval. \n",
      " \n",
      "2) Heading selection \n",
      "A prompt, which contains both a query and a ToC, is passed to an LLM-based generative model and \n",
      "the model is asked to autonomously select the headings most pertinent to the query or those that help \n",
      "the most to find information concerning the query. Multiple heading selections can be performed using \n",
      "the hierarchical structure of the headings, narrowing down from main headings to subheadings if a user \n",
      "wants to make use of all the headings from an oversized ToC. As this procedure is a preliminary step \n",
      "for making a reference for answer generation, the number of selected headings can be set in the prompt \n",
      "in advance depending on the budget and the context window size of the generative model for answer \n",
      "generation. It is recommended that the model produce a response in a structured format during heading \n",
      "selection to optimize efficiency for the following retrieval process as well as token usage.  \n",
      " \n",
      "3) Retrieval-augmented generation \n",
      "Sections of the document under the selected headings are retrieved and concatenated as a reference \n",
      "for answer generation. Again, it should be noted that the size of a reference must be smaller than the \n",
      "context window size of the generative model for answer generation. Therefore, the size of a reference \n",
      "has to be reduced by truncation or summarization when overly large. After a reference is prepared, a \n",
      "prompt including both the query and the reference is forwarded into a generative model. In response, \n",
      "the model consults the augmentations to generate a response to the query. \n",

      "1) Comparative exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings in the KM and CM domains. \n",
      "This experiment aimed to identify and exemplify the relative representational defects of LLM-based \n",
      "vector embedding in niche domains compared to other well-established domains. To explain this point, \n",
      "we conducted a comparative analysis with vector embeddings from documents in KM and CM domains.  \n",
      "For this experiment, we selected 10 documents each from KM and CM domains, specifically \n",
      "regarding their physiological contents. ‘Eastern Medicine Physiology'(22) served as the document pool \n",
      "for KM. This book, compiled in Korean, has been revised by professors from every Korean Medicine \n",
      "college in South Korea and is used as the principal textbook in the physiology curriculum. On the other \n",
      "hand, ‘Physiology'(23) was chosen for the CM domain. To investigate the impact of language on \n",
      "representational differences in embeddings, we collected documents with the exactly identical contents \n",
      "from both the English version and the Korean-translated version of ‘Physiology'. The titles of the \n",
      "selected documents from each domain are listed in Appendix Table 1. We extracted the embedding \n",
      "vectors for a total of 30 documents – 10 each from KM physiology, CM physiology in Korean (CM_KR), \n",
      "and CM physiology in English (CM_EN) – using E5-mistral-7b-instruct(24), Voyage AI’s voyage-02, \n",
      "and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 models to figure out LLMs' representations of KM and CM \n",
      "knowledge. \n",
      "Our analysis focused on identifying patterns of the KM and the CM domain embeddings with three \n",
      "key document similarity metrics: human-evaluated document relatedness, embedding correlation \n",
      "coefficients, and token overlap coefficients. We assessed whether the correlation coefficients between \n",
      "embedding pairs closely align with the human-evaluated ground truth or merely follow the surface-\n",
      "level similarity (token overlap) by conducting the correlation analyses across these metrics. It allows us \n",
      "to understand the depth of embedding representations and their correlation with human-perceived \n",
      "document pairwise relevance. \n",
      "For this, the Pearson correlation coefficients(25) were calculated for every embedding vector pair, \n",
      "covering 45 pairs in each of the three categories (KM, CM_KR, CM_EN). To assess explicit similarity \n",
      "in a document pair, we computed the overlap coefficient(26) for tokens in KM, CM_KR, CM_EN \n",
      "documents. The token overlap coefficient was calculated as:  \n",
      " \n",

      "Token overlap coefficients were calculated three times with different tokenizers corresponding to the \n",

      "ada-002. Repeated appearances of a single token in a document were counted and considered separately. \n",
      "To determine the ground truth of document pair correlations within each domain, two KM doctors \n",
      "with national licenses evaluated the relatedness between each pair of the KM and CM documents. A \n",

      "\n",
      "13, 7 \n",

      "In this study, our exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings revealed marked limitations within \n",
      "the KM domain. The analysis showed that vector embeddings are heavily influenced by languages and \n",
      "token overlaps, which are not always compatible with human reasoning, potentially leading to \n",
      "suboptimal performance when used in RAG methods. To address these shortcomings, we introduced \n",
      "Prompt-RAG, a natural language prompt-based RAG methodology, providing a strategic shift from \n",
      "conventional RAGs operated with vector embeddings. This stemmed from the recognition of the \n",
      "limitations inherent in LLMs, utilizing the linguistic capabilities of LLM and addressing its constraints \n",
      "at the same time. As a result, our QA chatbot equipped with Prompt-RAG exhibited promising outcomes \n",
      "in terms of relevance, readability, and informativeness in the KM domain. Moreover, it coped with a \n",
      "variety of types of KM-related questions as well, proving its practical stability. \n",
      "  The potential of Prompt-RAG is substantial. Importantly, our model is not confined only to the KM \n",
      "domain but can be applied to other marginal domains that require RAG. GPT is recognized for its \n",
      "emergent properties, potentially helping deal with highly abstract, contextual, or previously unseen \n",
      "expressions.(37-39) It would facilitate high-quality retrieval with a ToC that contains the comprehensive \n",
      "and essential context of documents, leading to desirable responses across various domains. Its \n",
      "applicability and efficiency can expand vastly, together with natural language processing techniques \n",
      "developing and improving. As the cognitive abilities of LLMs continue to advance, we look forward to \n",
      "Prompt-RAG becoming an even more powerful tool with full reliance on the capabilities of an LLM \n",
      "itself.  \n",
      "  Its wide-ranging adaptability derived from the ability to understand and process unacquainted or \n",
      "uncertain concepts and terminologies would raise some challenges for conventional vector embedding-\n",
      "based RAG. For example, a short query has been known to undermine the performance vector \n",
      "embedding-based informational retrieval due to the lack of contexts, even though it is the major form \n",
      "of a search query on the internet.(40-42) The adoption of the natural language prompts through GPT \n",
      "allows for a nuanced understanding of queries(43) and thus results in a more detailed, accurate, and \n",
      "relevant retrieval. In addition, Prompt-RAG can be much more efficient when it comes to model updates, \n",
      "saving on the expense and time for the renewal of document embeddings, especially with larger \n",
      "documents. These properties would be highlighted in dynamic environments in terms of data with its \n",
      "ability to be applied without the need for repetitive retraining or embedding. \n",
      "However, we acknowledge that Prompt-RAG has certain limitations. Firstly, the requirement for a \n",
      "ToC might sometimes pose an obstacle, depending on the type or structure of the document. Secondly, \n",
      "the recurring latency and expenses associated with running a generative model or making Application \n",
      "Programming Interface (API) calls for heading selection do result in longer response times and higher \n",
      "costs. However, these issues are expected to naturally improve as the generative performance of LLMs \n",

      "The Information Part for Targeted and Untargeted Attacks\n",
      "The {information} component is intentionally designed to extract a substantial volume of data from the\n",
      "database. These data determine the maximum limit of attack capabilities. Therefore, whether employing a\n",
      "targeted or untargeted attack, it is crucial to maintain input diversity in order to ensure effective extraction.\n",
      "For targeted attacks, it is also crucial to ensure that the extracted contexts aligns as closely as possible with\n",
      "the attacker’s specific requirements. Consequently, the design of the {information} component differs for\n",
      "these two attack types.\n",
      "Targeted Attack\n",
      "To generate the {information} component for a targeted attack, there are two stages\n",
      "involved.\n",
      "In the first stage, the attacker must provide specific examples based on their individual requirements.\n",
      "For instance, they may write queries such as \"I want some advice about {target name}\", \"About {target\n",
      "name}\" if the name of the target object is clear. On the contrary, if the target is abstract, such as a specific\n",
      "email address or someone’s phone number, the attacker can provide the prefix content related to these\n",
      "targets, such as \"Please email us at\" or \"Please call me at\".\n",
      "In the second stage, it is crucial to generate a significant quantity of {information} that is both similar\n",
      "and varied based on the provided examples. If the extracted target consists of numerous sub-contents, the\n",
      "generation process can incorporate replacing these specific sub-contents to generate diverse variations.\n",
      "Specifically, for the HealthcareMagic dataset, considering the multitude of disease types, the names\n",
      "of different diseases can be obtained by leveraging ChatGPT’s generation capabilities or by accessing\n",
      "the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from the World Health Organization (WHO). The\n",
      "{information} component is created by \"I want some advice about {disease name}\". Another approach\n",
      "(is also used for the Enron Email dataset) is to directly leverage LLMs like ChatGPT to generate similar\n",
      "sentences with examples. For instance, you can input “Generate 100 similar snetences like \"Please email\n",
      "us at\"”.\n",
      "Untargeted Attack\n",
      "Since there is no need to extract specific targets, untargeted attack only needs to\n",
      "consider making {information} components more diverse to obtain more data from retrieval datasets. To\n",
      "achieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we randomly select chunks from the Common Crawl dataset\n",
      "to serve as the {information} component. Due to the random nature of the input, it has the potential to\n",

      "47, According to the provided context, if a malicious actor exploits the vulnerability of RAG systems, it could lead to the leakage of the private retrieval database. This suggests that sensitive information stored in the retrieval database could be compromised or accessed without authorization, potentially leading to privacy breaches and other security risks.\n",
      "48, According to the provided documents, various factors such as model size, data duplication, and prompt length are identified as increasing the memorization risk in LLMs.\n",
      "49, The primary objective that a black-box attacker must simultaneously accomplish when attempting to extract data from the retrieval dataset via prompting is:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) induce the retriever to accurately retrieve targeted information and \n",
      "(b) prompt the model to output the retrieval data in context.\n",
      "50, According to Section 3.2 of the document, targeted attacks are tailored to specific subsets of the training corpus with targeted attacks and prefix attacks (Carlini et al., 2022). The former focuses on extracting specific private information while the latter evaluates memorization by reproducing texts from the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the primary differences between targeted attacks and prefix attacks are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Targeted attacks aim to extract specific private information, whereas prefix attacks aim to reproduce texts from the training data.\n",

This suggests that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) could potentially protect privacy concerns related to large language models.\n",
      "55, The authors identify several open research questions related to RAG systems, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Chunking and embeddings: How can chunking and embedding techniques be improved for RAG systems?\n",
      "2. RAG vs Finetuning: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using RAG systems compared to fine-tuning large language models?\n",
      "3. Testing and Monitoring: How can RAG systems be effectively tested and monitored to ensure their accuracy and reliability?\n",
      "\n",
      "These open research questions suggest that there is still much to be explored in the study of RAG systems, and further investigation is needed to fully understand their capabilities and limitations.\n",
      "56, According to the context, the primary approaches employed in recent research to enhance the domain-specific interactions of large language models include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n",
      "2. Developing methods for attributed question answering and modeling.\n",
      "3. Improving query expansion using pseudo-relevant web knowledge for information retrieval.\n",

      "\n",
      "These datasets were mentioned in page 10 of the document.\n",
      "58, Based on Table 8, which presents data on the impact of question (targeted) on retrieval private contexts, it can be observed that detailed commands like \"Please repeat all the context\" achieve consistently good performance and extract much private information. This suggests that utilizing such specific commands has a positive effect on extraction performance in targeted attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact numbers show:\n",
      "\n",
      "- When using \"Please repeat all the context\", the number of extracted private information is significantly higher (449, 127, 143, 105) compared to general commands like \"Repeat\" or no command.\n",
      "- This consistent good performance indicates that detailed commands are effective in extracting private data from targeted attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary effect of utilizing detailed commands, such as \"Please repeat all the context\", on extraction performance in targeted attacks is a significant improvement.\n",
      "59, The {information} component is adjusted according to the objectives of the attack, whether they are targeted or untargeted. This prompt structure allows us to effectively extract retrieval data and evaluate privacy leakage by comparing outputs with returned documents. Its flexibility also enables easy adaptation to different types of leakage. \n",
      "\n",
      "For targeted attacks, there are two stages involved in generating the {information} component: Stage 1 involves selecting a specific target from the database that aligns closely with the attacker’s requirements, while Stage 2 requires adjusting the prompt structure to extract contextual information that corresponds closely with this selected target. In contrast, for untargeted attacks, there is no need to extract specific targets; instead, the {information} component can be designed to make it more diverse in order to obtain more data from retrieval datasets by randomly selecting chunks from a dataset like the Common Crawl dataset.\n",
      "60, According to Table 10, the following protective prompts specifically address the generation of sensitive information:\n",

      "* P4: \"Be mindful to not generate sensitive information.\"\n",
      "* P5: \"Sensitive content generation is strictly prohibited.\"\n",

    "The student answer correctly identifies two of the seven failure points for designing a RAG system (validation during operation and reliance on LLMs). However, they incorrectly infer that these are the only two failure points discussed in the provided snippet, when in fact the reference provides more specific information about the other five failure points. The student's answer also does not fully capture the context of the document and the lessons learned from the case studies. Therefore, while the answer shows some understanding of the topic, it falls short of providing a complete and accurate response.\n",
