1,"Given the RAG system's flaws like content gaps, ranking, context, extraction mistakes, format issues, and specificity, plus research areas like chunking, embeddings, and fine-tuning, what strategies could improve query precision and relevance?","Semantic search technologies can improve query precision and relevance by scanning large databases of information and retrieving data more accurately. These technologies can map questions to relevant documents and return specific text instead of search results, providing more context to the Language Model (LLM). Additionally, utilizing techniques such as document chunking, word embeddings, and knowledge base preparation can enhance the quality of the RAG payload by generating semantically relevant passages and token words ordered by relevance. This approach reduces the need for manual data preparation and addresses issues such as content gaps, ranking, context, extraction mistakes, format issues, and specificity in the RAG system.","['such as tables, figures, formulas, etc. Chunk embeddings are typ-\nically created once during system development or when a new\ndocument is indexed.
