A RAG system involves finding documents that\nsemantically match a query and then passing the documents to a\nlarge language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right\nanswer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem\nof hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources\/references\nto generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating\ndocuments with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from lim-\nitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance\non LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the\nfailure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate\ndomains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons\nlearned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a\nRAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1)\nvalidation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and\n2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in\nat the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions\non RAG systems for the software engineering community.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022 Software and its engineering \u2192Empirical software valida-\ntion.\nKEYWORDS\nRetrieval Augmented Generation, RAG, SE4AI, Case Study\nACM Reference Format:\nScott Barnett, Stefanus Kurniawan, Srikanth Thudumu, Zach Brannelly, Mo-\nhamed Abdelrazek . 2024.

However, LLMs suffer from limitations when it comes\nto up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific knowledge currently\ncaptured in company\u2019s repositories. Two options to address this\nproblem are: a) Finetuning LLMs (continue training an LLM using\ndomain specific artifacts) which requires managing or serving a\nfine-tuned LLM; or b) use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nSystems that rely on LLMs for generation of answers using existing\n(extensible) knowledge artifacts. Both options have pros and cons\nrelated to privacy\/security of data, scalability, cost, skills required,\netc. In this paper, we focus on the RAG option.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a com-\npelling solution to this challenge. By integrating retrieval mecha-\nnisms with the generative capabilities of LLMs, RAG systems can\nsynthesise contextually relevant, accurate, and up-to-date informa-\ntion. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines\ninformation retrieval capabilities, and generative prowess of LLMs.\nThe retrieval component focuses on retrieving relevant information\nfor a user query from a data store. The generation component fo-\ncuses on using the retrieved information as a context to generate an\nanswer for the user query. RAG systems are an important use case\nas all unstructured information can now be indexed and available\nto query reducing development time no knowledge graph creation\nand limited data curation and cleaning.\nSoftware engineers building RAG systems are expected to pre-\nprocess domain knowledge captured as artifacts in different formats,\nstore processed information in appropriate data store (vector data-\nbase), implement or integrate the right query-artifact matching\nstrategy, rank matched artifacts, and call the LLMs API passing in\nuser queries and context documents. New advances for building\nRAG systems are constantly emerging [8, 12] but how they relate\nand perform for a specific application context has to be discovered.\nIn this work we present the lessons learned and 7 failure points\narising from 3 case studies. The purpose of this paper is to provide\n1) a reference to practitioners and 2) to present a research road\nmap for RAG systems. To the best of our knowledge, we present\nthe first empirical insight into the challenges with creating robust\nRAG systems. As advances in LLMs continue to take place, the\nsoftware engineering community has a responsibility to provide\nknowledge on how to realise robust systems with LLMs. This work\nis an important step for robustness in building RAG systems.\nResearch questions for this work include:\n\u2022 What are the failure points that occur when engineering a RAG\nsystem?

Due to the compute cost, data preparation\ntime and required resources using RAG without training or fine-\ntuning is an attractive proposition. However, challenges arise when\nusing large language models for information extraction such as\nperformance with long text [8].\nA recent survey [19] showed that large language models are\nused across the RAG pipeline including retriever, data generation,\nrewriter, and reader. Our work complements this survey by taking\na software engineering perspective to shine a light on what issues\nengineers will face and what software engineering research is nec-\nessary to realise solutions with the current state-of-the-art RAG\nsystems.\nEmerging work has looked at benchmarking RAG systems [3]\nbut not at the failures occurring during implementation. Software\nengineering research has investigated the use of RAG systems for\ncode-related tasks [15]. However, the application of RAG systems\nis broader than software engineering tasks. This paper comple-\nments existing work by presenting challenges faced during the\nimplementation of a RAG system with a focus on practitioners.\nErrors and failures that arise from RAG systems overlap with\nother information retrieval systems including 1) no metrics for\nquery rewriting, 2) document re-ranking, and 3) effective content\nsummarisation [19]. Our results confirm this The unique aspects\nare related to the semantic and generative nature of the use of large\nlanguage models including evaluating factual accuracy [16].\n3\nRETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION\nWith the explosion in popularity of large language model services\nsuch as ChatGPT2, Claude3, and Bard 4, people have explored their\nuse as a question and answering systems. While the performance\nis impressive [16] there are two fundamental challenges: 1) hallu-\ncinations - where the LLM produces a response that looks right\n1https:\/\/github.com\/openai\/evals\n2https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/\n3https:\/\/claude.ai\/\n4https:\/\/bard.google.com\/\nbut is incorrect, and 2) unbounded - no way to direct or update\nthe content of the output (other than through prompt engineering).\nA RAG system is an information retrieval approach designed to\novercome the limitations of using a LLM directly.\nRAG works by taking a natural language query is converted into\nan embedding which is used to semantically search a set of docu-\nments. Retrieved documents are then passed to a large language\nmodel to generate an answer. An overview of a RAG system is\nshown in Figure 1 as two separate processes, Index and Query. See\nthis survey for more details [19]\n3.1\nIndex Process\nIn a RAG system, the retrieval system works using embeddings\nthat provide a compressed semantic representation of the docu-\nment. An embedding is expressed as a vector of numbers. During\nthe Index process each document is split into smaller chunks that\nare converted into an embedding using an embedding model. The\noriginal chunk and the embedding are then indexed in a database.\nSoftware engineers face design decisions around how best to chunk\nthe document and how large a chunk should be. If chunks are too\nsmall certain questions cannot be answered, if the chunks are too\nlong then the answers include generated noise.\nDifferent types of documents require different chunking and pro-\ncessing stages. For example, video content requires a transcription\npipeline to extract the audio and convert to text prior to encoding\n(see subsection 4.2. The choice of which embedding to use also\nmatters as changing the embedding strategy requires re-indexing\nall chunks. An embedding should be chosen based on the ability to\nsemantically retrieve correct responses. This process depends on\nthe size of the chunks, the types of questions expected, the structure\nof the content and the application domain.\n3.2\nQuery Process\nThe Query process takes place at run time. A question expressed\nas natural language is first converted into a general query. To gen-\neralise the query a large language model is used which enables\nadditional context such as previous chat history to be included\nin the new query. An embedding is then calculated from the new\nquery to use for locating relevant documents from the database.\nTop-k similar documents are retrieved using a similarity method\nsuch as cosine similarity (vector databases have techniques such as\ninverted indexes to speed up retrieval time). The intuition is that\nchunks that are semantically close to the query are likely to contain\nthe answer.\nRetrieved documents are then re-ranked to maximise the likeli-\nhood that the chunk with the answer is located near the top. The\nnext stage is the Consolidator which is responsible for processing\nthe chunks. This stage is needed to overcome the limitations of\nlarge language models 1) token limit and 2) rate limit. Services such\nas OpenAI have hard limits on the amount of text to include in a\nprompt. This restricts the number of chunks to include in a prompt\nto extract out an answer and a reduction strategy is needed to chain\nprompts to obtain an answer. These online services also restrict the\nnumber of tokens to use within a time frame restricting the latency\nof a system. Software engineers need to consider these tradeoffs\nwhen designing a RAG system.\n","question":"Question: What is the name of the research direction that the authors propose for RAG systems based on the lessons learned from the three case studies?","answer":"Answer: A research direction for RAG systems based on the lessons learned from the 3 case studies."}
{"context":"Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval Augmented Generation System\nCAIN 2024, April 2024, Lisbon, Portugal\nFigure 1: Indexing and Query processes required for creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The indexing\nprocess is typically done at development time and queries at runtime. Failure points identified in this study are shown in red\nboxes. All required stages are underlined. Figure expanded from [19].\nThe final stage of a RAG pipeline is when the answer is extracted\nfrom the generated text. Readers are responsible for filtering the\nnoise from the prompt, adhering to formatting instructions (i.e. an-\nswer the question as a list of options), and producing the output to\nreturn for the query. Implementation of a RAG system requires cus-\ntomising multiple prompts to process questions and answers. This\nprocess ensures that questions relevant for the domain are returned.\nThe use of large language models to answer real time questions\nfrom documents opens up new application domains where question\nand answering is new capability. Thus, RAG systems are difficult\nto test as no data exists and needs to be experimentally discov-\nered through either a) synthetic data generation, or b) piloting the\nsystem with minimal testing.\n4\nCASE STUDIES\nThis study conducted three case studies to discover the challenges\nthat arise when implementing RAG systems. A summary of each of\nthe case studies is shown in Table 1. All scripts, data, and examples\nof each of the failure points for the BioASQ case study are available\nonline 5. The other two case studies have been excluded due to\nconfidentiality concerns.\n4.1\nCognitive Reviewer\nCognitive Reviewer is a RAG system designed to support researchers\nin analysing scientific documents. Researchers specify a research\nquestion or objective and then upload a collection of related re-\nsearch papers. All of the documents are then ranked in accordance\nwith the stated objective for the researcher to manually review.\nThe researcher can also ask questions directly against all of the\ndocuments. Cognitive Reviewer is currently used by PhD students\nfrom Deakin University to support their literature reviews. The\nCognitive Reviewer does the Index process at run time and relies\n5https:\/\/figshare.com\/s\/fbf7805b5f20d7f7e356\non a robust data processing pipeline to handle uploaded documents\ni.e. no quality control possible at development time. This system\nalso uses a ranking algorithm to sort the uploaded documents.\n4.2\nAI Tutor\nThe AI Tutor is a RAG system where students ask questions about\nthe unit and answers are sourced from the learning content. Stu-\ndents are able to verify the answers by accessing a sources list from\nwhere the answer came from. The AI Tutor works by integrating\ninto Deakin\u2019s learning management system, indexing all of the\ncontent including PDF documents, videos, and text documents. As\npart of the Index process, videos are transcribed using the deep\nlearning model Whisper [17] before being chunked. The AI Tutor\nwas developed between August 2023 to November 2023 for a pilot\nin a unit with 200 students that commenced the 30th of October\n2023. Our intention is to present the lessons learned during imple-\nmentation and present a followup findings at the conclusion of the\npilot. This RAG pipeline includes a rewriter to generalise queries.\nWe implemented a chat interface where previous dialogue between\nthe user and the AI Tutor was used as part of the context for each\nquestion. The rewriter considers this context and rewrites the query\nto resolve ambiguous requests such as \u2018Explain this concept further.\u2019\n4.3\nBiomedical Question and Answer\nThe previous case studies focused on documents with smaller con-\ntent sizes. To explore the issues at a larger scale we created a RAG\nsystem using the BioASQ [10] dataset comprised of questions, links\nto document, and answers. The answers to questions were one of\nyes\/no, text summarisation, factoid, or list. This dataset was pre-\npared by biomedical experts and contains domain specific question\nand answer pairs. We downloaded 4017 open access documents\nfrom the BioASQ dataset and had a total of 1000 questions. All\ndocuments were indexed and the questions asked against the RAG\nsystem. The generated questions were then evaluated using the\n","question":"Question: What is the total number of questions in the BioASQ dataset used in the case study?","answer":"Answer: 1000"}

We found that the automated\nevaluation was more pessimistic than a human rater for this domain.\nHowever, one threat to validity with this finding is that BioASQ is\na domain specific dataset and the reviewers were not experts i.e.\nthe large language model may know more than a non-expert.\n5\nFAILURE POINTS OF RAG SYSTEMS\nFrom the case studies we identified a set of failure points presented\nbelow. The following section addresses the research question What\nare the failure points that occur when engineering a RAG system?\nFP1 Missing Content The first fail case is when asking a ques-\ntion that cannot be answered from the available documents.\nIn the happy case the RAG system will respond with some-\nthing like \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know\". However, for questions that\nare related to the content but don\u2019t have answers the system\ncould be fooled into giving a response.\nFP2 Missed the Top Ranked Documents The answer to the\nquestion is in the document but did not rank highly enough\nto be returned to the user. In theory, all documents are ranked\nand used in the next steps. However, in practice the top K\ndocuments are returned where K is a value selected based\non performance.\nFP3 Not in Context - Consolidation strategy Limitations\nDocuments with the answer were retrieved from the data-\nbase but did not make it into the context for generating an\nanswer. This occurs when many documents are returned\nfrom the database and a consolidation process takes place to\nretrieve the answer.\nFP4 Not Extracted Here the answer is present in the context,\nbut the large language model failed to extract out the correct\nanswer. Typically, this occurs when there is too much noise\nor contradicting information in the context.\nFP5 Wrong Format The question involved extracting informa-\ntion in a certain format such as a table or list and the large\nlanguage model ignored the instruction.\nFP6 Incorrect Specificity The answer is returned in the re-\nsponse but is not specific enough or is too specific to address\nthe user\u2019s need. This occurs when the RAG system designers\nhave a desired outcome for a given question such as teach-\ners for students. In this case, specific educational content\nshould be provided with answers not just the answer. Incor-\nrect specificity also occurs when users are not sure how to\nask a question and are too general.\n6https:\/\/github.com\/openai\/evals\nFP7 Incomplete Incomplete answers are not incorrect but miss\nsome of the information even though that information was in\nthe context and available for extraction. An example question\nsuch as \u201cWhat are the key points covered in documents\nA, B and C?\u201d A better approach is to ask these questions\nseparately.\n6\nLESSONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nDIRECTIONS\nThe lessons learned from the three case studies are shown in Table 2.\nWe present our findings for the research question: What are the\nkey considerations when engineering a RAG system? Based on our\ntakeaways we identified multiple potential research areas linked to\nRAG as follows:\n6.1\nChunking and Embeddings\nChunking documents sounds trivial. However, the quality of chunk-\ning affects the retrieval process in many ways and in particular\non the embeddings of the chunk then affects the similarity and\nmatching of chunks to user queries. There are two ways of chunk-\ning: heuristics based (using punctuation, end of paragraph, etc.),\nand semantic chunking (using the semantics in the text to inform\nstart-end of a chunk). Further research should explore the tradeoffs\nbetween these methods and their effects on critical downstream\nprocesses like embedding and similarity matching. A systematic\nevaluation framework comparing chunking techniques on metrics\nlike query relevance and retrieval accuracy would benefit the field.\nEmbeddings represent another active research area, including\ngenerating embeddings for multimedia and multimodal chunks\nsuch as tables, figures, formulas, etc. Chunk embeddings are typ-\nically created once during system development or when a new\ndocument is indexed. Query preprocessing significantly impacts\na RAG system\u2019s performance, particularly handling negative or\nambiguous queries. Further research is needed on architectural pat-\nterns and approaches [5] to address the inherent limitations with\nembeddings (quality of a match is domain specific).\n6.2\nRAG vs Finetuning\nLLMs are great world models due to the amount of training data, and\nfinetuning tasks applied on the model before it\u2019s released. However,\nthese models are general-purpose models (may not know the very\nspecifics of your domain) and also not up to date (there is a cutoff\ndate on their knowledge). Fine-tuning and RAG offer two potential\ncustomisation pathways, each with distinct tradeoffs. Finetuning\nrequires curating internal datasets to adapt and train the LLM on.\nHowever, all your data are baked into the model and you need to\n","question":"Question: What are the key considerations when engineering a RAG system?","answer":"Answer: The key considerations when engineering a RAG system include chunking and embeddings, RAG vs finetuning, and addressing failure points such as missing content, missed top-ranked documents, not in context, not extracted, wrong format, incorrect specificity, and incomplete answers."}

Furthermore,\nas the foundation model itself evolves or you get new data to add to\nthe model, you will need to run finetuning again. On the other side,\nRAG systems seem to offer a pragmatic solution allowing you to\nchunk your data as needed and only use relevant chunks into the\ncontext to ask the LLM to generate an answer from the included\ncontext. This facilitates continuously updating the knowledge with\nnew documents and also gives the control over what chunks the user\nis able to access. However, optimal strategies for chunk embedding,\nretrieval, and contextual fusion remain active research. Further\nwork should systematically compare finetuning and RAG paradigms\nacross factors including accuracy, latency, operating costs, and\nrobustness.\n6.3\nTesting and Monitoring RAG systems\nSoftware engineering best practices are still emerging for RAG sys-\ntems. Software testing and test case generation are one of the areas\nfor refinement. RAG systems require questions and answers that are\napplication specific often unavailable when indexing unstructured\ndocuments. Emerging work has considered using LLMs for gen-\nerating questions from multiple documents [4]. How to generate\nrealistic domain relevant questions and answers remains an open\nproblem.\nOnce suitable test data is available quality metrics are also re-\nquired to assist engineers in making quality tradeoffs. Using large\nlanguage models is expensive, introduces latency concerns, and has\nperformance characteristics that all change with each new release.\nThis characteristic has previously been studied for machine learn-\ning systems [5, 6] but the required adaptations (if any) have yet to\nbe applied to LLM based systems such as RAGs. Another idea is to\nincorporate ideas from self-adaptive systems to support monitoring\nand adapting RAG systems, preliminary work has started for other\nmachine learning applications [2].\n7\nCONCLUSION\nRAG systems are a new information retrieval that leverages LLMs.\nSoftware engineers increasingly interact with RAG systems a)\nthrough implementing semantic search, or b) through new code-\ndependent tasks. This paper presented the lessons learned from 3\ncase studies including an empirical investigation involving 15,000\ndocuments and 1000 questions. Our findings provide a guide to\npractitioners by presenting the challenges faced when implement-\ning RAG systems. We also included future research directions for\nRAG systems related to 1) chunking and embeddings, 2) RAG vs\nFinetuning, and 3) Testing and Monitoring. Large language models\nare going to continue to obtain new capabilities of interest to engi-\nneers and researchers.

{"context":"2 \n1. Introduction \nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine a generative model with an information \nretrieval function, designed to overcome the inherent constraints of generative models.(1) They \nintegrate the robustness of a large language model (LLM) with the relevance and up-to-dateness of \nexternal information sources, resulting in responses that are not only natural and human-like but also \nthe latest, accurate, and contextually relevant to the query.(1-4) The interaction of the two modules \n(retrieval and generation) enables responses that would not be achievable with either module alone, \nmaking RAG more than just the sum of its components. This approach represents a significant milestone \nin the field of generative models by enabling the induction of high-quality responses in less-explored \ndomains at a low expense.(5, 6)  \nIn the conventional RAG operation, the initial step involves converting input queries into vector \nembeddings, which are then used to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database. Following this, \nthe generative part of RAG utilizes the retrieved external data for producing contextually rich \nresponses.(7) Thus, both the embedding and generative models are considered crucial factors in the \nperformance of RAG, directly affecting the retrieval process.(8) However, in niche domains, the \nperformance of generic LLM-based embedding models appears suboptimal compared to their \neffectiveness in more general fields. The lack of specialized training data in these domains results in \nembeddings that do not adequately capture the nuances and specificity of the domain(9), leading to less \naccurate and contextually relevant information retrieval. Despite the evident presence of these \nfunctional limitations, they have not been much identified through experiments, therefore the optimality \nof the conventional LLM-based vector embedding RAG methods for niche domains has remained in \nobscurity. Researchers have been aware of these shortcomings of LLMs and have explored \nsupplementary processes such as fine-tuning to improve the performance.(8, 10-12) However, the cost \nof fine-tuning, especially when it involves adjusting the entire or majority of parameters in LLM, has \nrapidly become expensive, thereby increasing the demand for alternative solutions.(13-15)  \nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology: Prompt-RAG. This new approach to \nRAG eliminates the reliance on vector embeddings, adopting a more direct and flexible retrieval process \nbased on natural language prompts. It involves a large-scale pre-trained generative model that handles \nthe entire steps from document retrieval to response generation without the need for a vector database \nor an algorithm for indexing and selecting vectors, thus having the processing structure of RAG greatly \nsimplified. Therefore, it not only takes advantage of the RAG\u2019s strength but also circumvents the \nlimitations of conventional vector embedding-based methodology. Prompt-RAG is based on \nmaximizing the use of the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs. Especially using \nthe latest GPT model, our method can compensate for the deficiencies in vector embedding-based RAG \narising from the shortage of domain-specific knowledge. \nTo examine the utility of Prompt-RAG in practice, we conducted two exemplary studies focusing on \nthe Korean Medicine (KM) domain. KM, a branch of traditional East Asian medicine, has diverged \nfrom traditional Chinese medicine and Japanese Kampo medicine in aspects like physiological theories, \ntreatments, and Sasang constitutional medicine.(16, 17) It was reported that GPT models have achieved \nexcellent results in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)(18-20), while \n","question":"Here is your answer:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary function of the information retrieval module in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model?","answer":"Answer: The primary function of the information retrieval module in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database."}

{"context":"4 \n2. Design of Prompt-RAG \nIn this study, we introduce Prompt-RAG, a novel approach distinct from the conventional vector \nembedding-based RAG. Prompt-RAG consists of three steps: preprocessing, heading selection, and \nretrieval-augmented generation. The overall scheme of Prompt-RAG might seem similar to that of \nconventional RAG methods. However, details in each step are quite distinguishable especially in that \nconventional RAGs rely on a complex multi-step process involving the vectorization of documents and \nalgorithmic retrieval from a vector database for a generative model's response. The workflows of vector \nembedding-based RAG and our method are depicted in Figure 1. \n \n \nFigure. 1. Comparative workflows of two RAG models. (A) depicts the vector embedding-based RAG \nprocess. Relevant pieces of information are retrieved from a database of document embeddings through \nalgorithms. The retrieved data are augmented in a generative model to produce a response. (B) illustrates \nthe process of Prompt-RAG. An LLM-based generative model directly uses a table of contents for \nconstructing a contextual reference, followed by generating a response with it. \nAbbreviation: RAG, Retrieval-augmented generation; LLM, Large-language model. \n \n1) Preprocessing \nPrompt-RAG initiates by extracting or creating a Table of Contents (ToC) from a user\u2019s document(s), \nwhich is the main subject of the retrieval. The procedure can be done flexibly depending on the type of \ndocument and the user's preferences. One of the most ideal cases is that a ToC is already prepared, made \nby the author(s) of the document. And yet, even in the absence of a pre-determined ToC, it can be \narbitrarily generated, for example, using a generative model or in a manual way, based on the \ndocument's quantitative, semantic, or individual divisions. It should be noted that the size of a ToC must \nnot exceed the context window size of the generative model for heading selection. Consequently, some \nheadings or details of the ToC (e.g., heading or page numbers, or hierarchical structure) might need to \nbe removed in order to reduce the number of tokens. The body of the document should then be divided \n","question":"Question: What is the abbreviation of LLM in the context of Prompt-RAG?","answer":"Answer: Large-language model."}
{"context":"5 \ninto sections according to the headings and prepared for subsequent retrieval. \n \n2) Heading selection \nA prompt, which contains both a query and a ToC, is passed to an LLM-based generative model and \nthe model is asked to autonomously select the headings most pertinent to the query or those that help \nthe most to find information concerning the query. Multiple heading selections can be performed using \nthe hierarchical structure of the headings, narrowing down from main headings to subheadings if a user \nwants to make use of all the headings from an oversized ToC. As this procedure is a preliminary step \nfor making a reference for answer generation, the number of selected headings can be set in the prompt \nin advance depending on the budget and the context window size of the generative model for answer \ngeneration. It is recommended that the model produce a response in a structured format during heading \nselection to optimize efficiency for the following retrieval process as well as token usage.  \n \n3) Retrieval-augmented generation \nSections of the document under the selected headings are retrieved and concatenated as a reference \nfor answer generation.

Therefore, the size of a reference \nhas to be reduced by truncation or summarization when overly large.

Experiments \n1) Comparative exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings in the KM and CM domains. \nThis experiment aimed to identify and exemplify the relative representational defects of LLM-based \nvector embedding in niche domains compared to other well-established domains. To explain this point, \nwe conducted a comparative analysis with vector embeddings from documents in KM and CM domains.  \nFor this experiment, we selected 10 documents each from KM and CM domains, specifically \nregarding their physiological contents. \u2018Eastern Medicine Physiology'(22) served as the document pool \nfor KM. This book, compiled in Korean, has been revised by professors from every Korean Medicine \ncollege in South Korea and is used as the principal textbook in the physiology curriculum. On the other \nhand, \u2018Physiology'(23) was chosen for the CM domain. To investigate the impact of language on \nrepresentational differences in embeddings, we collected documents with the exactly identical contents \nfrom both the English version and the Korean-translated version of \u2018Physiology'. The titles of the \nselected documents from each domain are listed in Appendix Table 1. We extracted the embedding \nvectors for a total of 30 documents \u2013 10 each from KM physiology, CM physiology in Korean (CM_KR), \nand CM physiology in English (CM_EN) \u2013 using E5-mistral-7b-instruct(24), Voyage AI\u2019s voyage-02, \nand OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 models to figure out LLMs' representations of KM and CM \nknowledge. \nOur analysis focused on identifying patterns of the KM and the CM domain embeddings with three \nkey document similarity metrics: human-evaluated document relatedness, embedding correlation \ncoefficients, and token overlap coefficients. We assessed whether the correlation coefficients between \nembedding pairs closely align with the human-evaluated ground truth or merely follow the surface-\nlevel similarity (token overlap) by conducting the correlation analyses across these metrics. It allows us \nto understand the depth of embedding representations and their correlation with human-perceived \ndocument pairwise relevance. \nFor this, the Pearson correlation coefficients(25) were calculated for every embedding vector pair, \ncovering 45 pairs in each of the three categories (KM, CM_KR, CM_EN). To assess explicit similarity \nin a document pair, we computed the overlap coefficient(26) for tokens in KM, CM_KR, CM_EN \ndocuments.

The expanded table of contents exceeded the context window \nsize for heading selection, so some headings were removed to handle this issue. The body of the book \nwas then segmented according to the modified headings for the subsequent retrieval. \nWe passed a model based on GPT-4 a prompt containing both the revised ToC and a query, asking \nthe model to identify five pertinent headings from the ToC.

Notably, CM_EN exhibited statistically significant positive correlations across all models \n(0.725, 0.670, and 0.625, respectively), indicating a robust positive correlation in the context of CM \nand English compared to KM and Korean. In contrast, the correlations in KM were either weak or \nslightly negative (-0.016 and 0.167), with the exception of the E5-mistral-7b-instruct model, which \nyielded a moderate 0.503. \nSecondly, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the embedding correlation coefficients and \ntoken overlap coefficients showed varied patterns. In CM_EN, the E5-mistral-7b-instruct model had a \nPearson's correlation coefficient of 0.438, and voyage-02 had a coefficient of 0.518, both indicating \nmoderate positive correlations. However, these correlations, including the one for text-embedding-ada-\n002, were all lower than those observed for human-evaluated document relatedness. For KM, significant \npositive correlations were observed in voyage-02 and text-embedding-ada-002, with coefficients of \n0.429 and 0.501, respectively.

{"context":"18 \n5. Discussion \nIn this study, our exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings revealed marked limitations within \nthe KM domain. The analysis showed that vector embeddings are heavily influenced by languages and \ntoken overlaps, which are not always compatible with human reasoning, potentially leading to \nsuboptimal performance when used in RAG methods. To address these shortcomings, we introduced \nPrompt-RAG, a natural language prompt-based RAG methodology, providing a strategic shift from \nconventional RAGs operated with vector embeddings. This stemmed from the recognition of the \nlimitations inherent in LLMs, utilizing the linguistic capabilities of LLM and addressing its constraints \nat the same time. As a result, our QA chatbot equipped with Prompt-RAG exhibited promising outcomes \nin terms of relevance, readability, and informativeness in the KM domain. Moreover, it coped with a \nvariety of types of KM-related questions as well, proving its practical stability. \n  The potential of Prompt-RAG is substantial. Importantly, our model is not confined only to the KM \ndomain but can be applied to other marginal domains that require RAG. GPT is recognized for its \nemergent properties, potentially helping deal with highly abstract, contextual, or previously unseen \nexpressions.(37-39) It would facilitate high-quality retrieval with a ToC that contains the comprehensive \nand essential context of documents, leading to desirable responses across various domains. Its \napplicability and efficiency can expand vastly, together with natural language processing techniques \ndeveloping and improving. As the cognitive abilities of LLMs continue to advance, we look forward to \nPrompt-RAG becoming an even more powerful tool with full reliance on the capabilities of an LLM \nitself.  \n  Its wide-ranging adaptability derived from the ability to understand and process unacquainted or \nuncertain concepts and terminologies would raise some challenges for conventional vector embedding-\nbased RAG. For example, a short query has been known to undermine the performance vector \nembedding-based informational retrieval due to the lack of contexts, even though it is the major form \nof a search query on the internet.(40-42) The adoption of the natural language prompts through GPT \nallows for a nuanced understanding of queries(43) and thus results in a more detailed, accurate, and \nrelevant retrieval. In addition, Prompt-RAG can be much more efficient when it comes to model updates, \nsaving on the expense and time for the renewal of document embeddings, especially with larger \ndocuments. These properties would be highlighted in dynamic environments in terms of data with its \nability to be applied without the need for repetitive retraining or embedding. \nHowever, we acknowledge that Prompt-RAG has certain limitations. Firstly, the requirement for a \nToC might sometimes pose an obstacle, depending on the type or structure of the document. Secondly, \nthe recurring latency and expenses associated with running a generative model or making Application \nProgramming Interface (API) calls for heading selection do result in longer response times and higher \ncosts. However, these issues are expected to naturally improve as the generative performance of LLMs \ncontinues to develop and model pricing plans become more economical, as has been the trend. \nExplorations and developments in model compression and light-weight artificial intelligence \ntechnologies for resource-constrained devices have been recently encouraged by the popularization of \nindividual edge devices.(44-46) This trend seems to be extending to natural language processing \ndomains as well(47), which would help solve the latency issue of our model.

However, we find that existing RAG sys-\ntems are inadequate in answering multi-hop\nqueries, which require retrieving and reasoning\nover multiple pieces of supporting evidence.\nFurthermore, to our knowledge, no existing\nRAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-\nhop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel\ndataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a\nknowledge base, a large collection of multi-\nhop queries, their ground-truth answers, and\nthe associated supporting evidence. We detail\nthe procedure of building the dataset, utiliz-\ning an English news article dataset as the un-\nderlying RAG knowledge base. We demon-\nstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-\nRAG in two experiments. The first experiment\ncompares different embedding models for re-\ntrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the\nsecond experiment, we examine the capabili-\nties of various state-of-the-art LLMs, includ-\ning GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in rea-\nsoning and answering multi-hop queries given\nthe evidence. Both experiments reveal that ex-\nisting RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily\nin retrieving and answering multi-hop queries.\nWe hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable re-\nsource for the community in developing effec-\ntive RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater\nadoption of LLMs in practice. The MultiHop-\nRAG and implemented RAG system is publicly\navailable at https:\/\/github.com\/yixuantt\/\nMultiHop-RAG\/.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs),\nsuch as ChatGPT, has fostered a wide range of inno-\nvations, powering intelligent chatbots and other nat-\nural language processing (NLP) applications (Ope-\nFigure 1: RAG with multi-hop query.\nnAI, 2023). One promising use case is Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) (Asai et al., 2023),\nwhich optimizes the output of a large language\nmodel by referencing an external knowledge base\noutside of the LLM training data sources before\ngenerating a response. RAG improves LLM\u2019s re-\nsponse (Borgeaud et al., 2022) and also mitigates\nthe occurrence of hallucinations, thereby enhancing\nthe models\u2019 credibility (Gao et al., 2023). LLM-\nbased frameworks, such as LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022)\nand LangChain (Chase, 2022), specialize in sup-\nporting RAG pipelines.\nIn real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) applications, a user\u2019s query often necessi-\ntates retrieving and reasoning over evidence from\nmultiple documents, a process known as multi-hop\nquery. For instance, consider financial analysis us-\ning a database of financial reports. A financial ana-\nlyst might query, Which company among Google,\nApple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit mar-\ngins in their third-quarter reports for 2023? or\ninquire about a specific company\u2019s performance\nover time, such as How does Apple\u2019s sales trend\nlook over the past three years?

We demonstrate this multi-hop retrieval\nprocess in Figure 1.\nHowever, existing RAG benchmarks, such as\nRGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RECALL (Liu et al.,\n2023), mainly evaluate a simple case where the an-\nswer of a query can be retrieved and solved using\none single piece of evidence. None of these bench-\nmarks assess the retrieval and reasoning capability\nof LLMs for complex multi-hop queries. To ad-\ndress this gap and make RAG benchmarking more\nclosely resemble real-world scenarios, in this paper,\nwe introduce MultiHop-RAG. To our knowledge,\nMultiHop-RAG is one of the first RAG datasets\nfocusing specifically on multi-hop queries.\nBased on the RAG queries commonly encoun-\ntered in real-world scenarios, we first categorize\nmulti-hop queries into four types: Inference query,\nComparison query, Temporal query, and Null\nquery. The first three types \u2014 Inference, Com-\nparison, and Temporal \u2014 require the retrieval and\nanalysis of evidence from multiple sources, encom-\npassing tasks like inferring relationships, compar-\ning data points, and sequencing events over time.\nThe Null query represents a scenario where the\nquery cannot be derived from the knowledge base.\nThis category is crucial for assessing whether an\nLLM might hallucinate an answer to a multi-hop\nquery when the retrieved text lacks relevance.\nWe construct our RAG knowledge base using a\ncollection of news articles. Using GPT-4 as a data\ngenerator, we then take an extensive procedure to\nconstruct a diverse set of multi-hop queries, each\nrequiring the retrieval and reasoning over multiple\ndocuments. An example of query construction is\nshown in Table 1. First, we begin by extracting\nfactual sentences from each news article as evi-\ndence. For example, an extracted piece of evidence\nfrom an article may state: \u201cBack then, just like\ntoday, home prices had boomed for years before\nFed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest\nrates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation.\u201d\nSecond, we input each evidence piece into GPT-4,\nprompting it to rephrase the evidence into a claim.\nThis claim is clarified with a disambiguated topic\nand entity. For instance, GPT-4 might rephrase the\naforementioned evidence into: \u201cFederal Reserve\nofficials were forced to aggressively hike interest\nrates to combat inflation after years of booming\nhome prices\u201d, identifying \u201cInterest rate hikes to\ncombat inflation\u201d as the topic and \u201cFederal Re-\nserve\u201d as the entity. These topics and entities act as\nbridges for constructing multi-hop queries, known\nas bridge-topic or bridge-entity. Next, we use GPT-\n4 to generate specific multi-hop queries related to\nthe same bridge-topic or bridge-entity, accompa-\nnied by the correct answers. Lastly, we undertake\na validation step to ensure the data quality.\nWe demonstrate the benchmarking capabilities\nof MultiHop-RAG using two experiments, utilizing\na RAG system implemented with LlamaIndex (Liu,\n2022). The first experiment involves a comparison\nof different embedding models for retrieving rele-\nvant evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second\nexperiment, we assess the reasoning and answering\nabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including\nGPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM, Claude-2, Llama2-70B,\nand Mixtral-8x7B, for multi-hop queries when re-\ntrieved text is provided. The results from both ex-\nperiments indicate that the current RAG implemen-\ntations are inadequate for effectively retrieving and\nanswering multi-hop queries.

{"context":"this challenging MultiHop-RAG dataset and hope it\nwill be a valuable resource for the community in de-\nveloping and benchmarking RAG systems, thereby\nunleashing the great potential of generative AI in\npractice.\n2\nRAG with multi-Hop queries\n2.1\nRetrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)\nIn an RAG application, we utilize an external cor-\npus, denoted as D, which comprises multiple docu-\nments and serves as the knowledge base. Each doc-\nument within this corpus, represented as di \u2208D, is\nsegmented into a set of chunks.These chunks are\nthen transformed into vector representations using\nan embedding model and stored in an embedding\ndatabase. Given a user query q, the system typi-\ncally retrieves the top-K chunks that best match the\nquery. These chunks constitute the retrieval set\nfor query q, represented as Rq = {r1, r2, ..., rK}.\nThe retrieved chunks, combined with the query\nand an optional prompt, are then fed into an LLM\nto generate a final answer, following the format:\nLLM(q, Rq, prompt) \u2192answer.\n2.2\nMulti-Hop Query\nWe define a multi-hop query as one that requires\nretrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of\nsupporting evidence to provide an answer. In other\nwords, for a multi-hop query q, the chunks in the\nretrieval set Rq collectively provide an answer\nto q. For example, the query \"Which company\namong Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the\nlargest profit margins in their third-quarter reports\nfor 2023?\" requires 1) retrieving relevant pieces of\nevidence related to profit margins from the reports\nof the three companies; 2) generating an answer by\ncomparing and reasoning from the multiple pieces\nof retrieved evidence. This differs from a single-\nhop query such as \"What is Google\u2019s profit margin\nin the third-quarter reports for 2023,\" where the\nanswer can be directly derived from a single piece\nof evidence.\nBased on the queries commonly used in real-\nworld RAG systems, we identify four types of\nmulti-hop queries. For each type, we present a\nhypothetical query within the context of a financial\nRAG system, where the knowledge base consists\nof a collection of annual reports.\nInference query: For such a query q, the answer\nis deduced through reasoning from the retrieval\nset Rq. An example of an inference query might\nbe: Which report discusses the supply chain risk of\nApple, the 2019 annual report or the 2020 annual\nreport?\nComparison query: For such a query q, the an-\nswer requires a comparison of evidence within the\nretrieval set Rq. For instance, a comparison query\nmight ask: Did Netflix or Google report higher\nrevenue for the year 2023?\"\nTemporal query: For such a query q, the answer\nrequires an analysis of the temporal information\nof the retrieved chunks. For example, a temporal\nquery may ask: Did Apple introduce the AirTag\ntracking device before or after the launch of the 5th\ngeneration iPad Pro?\nNull query: For such as query q, the answer cannot\nbe derived from the retrieved set Rq. We include\nthe null query to assess the generation quality, es-\npecially regarding the issue of hallucination. For a\nnull query, even though a retrieved set is provided,\nan LLM should produce a null response instead\nof hallucinating an answer. For example, assum-\ning ABCD is a non-existent company, a null query\nmight ask: What are the sales of company ABCD\nas reported in its 2022 and 2023 annual reports?\n2.3\nEvaluation Metrics\nAn RAG system handling multi-hop queries can be\nassessed from two key aspects: retrieval evaluation\nand generation evaluation.\nRetrieval Evaluation: Evidently, the quality of\nthe retrieval set Rq determines the final genera-\ntion quality. We compare the retrieved set with\nthe ground truth evidence associated with each\nquery, except for the null queries, as they have\nno evidence to derive from. Assuming the top-\nK chunks are retrieved, i.e., |Rq| = K, we use\nretrieval evaluation metrics including Mean Aver-\nage Precision at K (MAP@K), Mean Reciprocal\nRank at K (MRR@K), and Hit Rate at K (Hit@K).\nMAP@K measures the average top-K retrieval pre-\ncision across all queries. MRR@K calculates the\naverage of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant\nchunk for each query, considering the top-K re-\ntrieved set. Hit@K metric measures the fraction of\nevidence that appears in the top-K retrieved set.\nResponse Evaluation: Since the multi-hop\nquery requires reasoning over multiple pieces of\nretrieved chunks, we can also evaluate the reason-\ning capability of the LLM by comparing the LLM\nresponse with the ground truth answer of the query.\n","question":"Question: What is the purpose of null queries in the evaluation of RAG systems?","answer":"Answer: The purpose of null queries in the evaluation of RAG systems is to assess the generation quality, especially regarding the issue of hallucination."}
{"context":"Figure 2: MultiHop-RAG Construction Pipeline.\n3\nA Benchmarking Dataset:\nMultiHop-RAG\nIn this section, we provide detailed information\non the construction of the MultiHop-RAG dataset.\nSpecifically, we describe the process of creating a\nset of multi-hop queries, along with the correspond-\ning ground truth evidence sets and answers derived\nfrom a collection of news articles.\n3.1\nMultiHop-RAG Construction\nStep 1: Dataset Collection. We download a news\ndataset using the mediastack API 1, a REST API in-\nterface delivering worldwide news data. The news\ndata source comprises various English-language\nwebsites covering a range of news categories: en-\ntertainment, business, sports, technology, health,\nand science. To mimic real-world RAG scenarios,\nwhere the knowledge base data, such as an enter-\nprise\u2019s internal data, may differ from the LLMs\u2019\ntraining data, we select news articles published\nfrom September 26, 2023, to December 26, 2023.\nThis timeframe extends beyond the knowledge cut-\noff of some widely-used LLMs, including Chat-\nGPT and LLaMA, as of the time of writing. This\nselection also helps in teasing out the possibility\nof the underlying LLM having been exposed to\nthese news articles. We only keep articles with a\ntoken length greater than or equal to 1,024. Every\n1https:\/\/mediastack.com\/\nnews article is paired with metadata, including the\ntitle, publish date, author, category, URL, and news\nsource.\nStep 2: Evidence Extraction. For each article, we\nextract factual or opinion sentences using a trained\nlanguage model 2. These factual sentences are later\nused as evidence for answering multi-hop queries.\nWe retain only those news articles containing ev-\nidence that may have overlapping keywords with\nother news articles. This allows us to later create\nmulti-hop queries where the answer\u2019s evidences\nare drawn from multiple sources.\nStep 3: Claim, Bridge-Entity, Bridge-Topic Gen-\neration. Our goal is to use GPT-4 to automatically\ngenerate high-quality multi-hop queries using the\nevidence set. However, the raw evidence obtained\nfrom Step 2 is not ideal for query generation due\nto inconsistency in linguistic structure. For exam-\nple, some pieces of evidence use pronouns to refer\nto subjects and lack the actual entity in the text.\nTo address this, we employ GPT-4 to paraphrase\nthe evidence, which we refer to as claims, given\nthe original evidence and its context. To ensure\nconsistency between the generated claim and the\nevidence, we further perform fact-checking using\nthe UniEval (Zhong et al., 2022) framework to ver-\nify the alignment between the evidence and claim.\nAppendix A presents the prompt used for GPT-4\nfor claim generation.\nBridge-Entity and Bridge-Topic: The shared en-\ntity or topic across pieces of evidence is referred to\nas the bridge-entity or bridge-topic. These bridge-\nentities or bridge-topics can be used to link dif-\nferent pieces of evidence from which a multi-hop\nquery\u2019s answer is derived. For example, in a claim\nsuch as \u201cGoogle reports its third-quarter results for\n2023, showcasing a detailed overview of its finan-\ncial performance, including revenue growth, profit\nmargins\u201d, the term profit margin can be viewed as\na bridge-topic and the term Google can be viewed\nas a bridge-entity that links the different pieces of\nevidence. We prompt GPT-4 to identify the bridge-\nentity and bridge-topic for each claim. Appendix A\nalso presents the prompt used for GPT-4 for bridge\ngeneration.\nStep 4: Query and Answer Generation. In this\nstep, we leverage the bridge-entity or bridge-topic\nto generate multi-hop queries. Specifically, we first\ngroup the claims having the same bridge-entity or\n2https:\/\/huggingface.co\/lighteternal\/fact-or-opinion-xlmr-\nel\n","question":"Question: What is the API interface used to download a news dataset?","answer":"Answer: The mediastack API."}
{"context":"bridge-topic into a claim set. We restrict the claim\nset to have at least two claims but no more than four\nclaims. For each type of query, we feed the claim\nset to GPT-4 and prompt it with an instruction to\ngenerate a query with information from each claim.\nBelow, we explain the specifications for different\nmulti-hop query types. In the construction of each\nquery, we also include the source of the news article\nwhere the supporting evidence is associated with\nto mimic real-world RAG scenarios. Appendix\nA presents the prompts used for GPT-4 for query\ngeneration.\nInference Query: These queries are formulated\nby synthesizing the various characterizations of the\nbridge-entity across multiple claims, with the final\nanswer being the identification of the entity itself.\nComparison Query: These queries are struc-\ntured to compare the similarities and differences\nrelated to the bridge entity or topic. The resultant\nanswer to such queries is typically a definitive \u201cyes\u201d\nor \u201cno\u201d, based on the comparison.\nTemporal Query: These queries explore the\ntemporal ordering of events across different points\nin time. The answer to such queries is typically a\n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or a single temporal indicator word\nlike \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d.\nNull Query: Null query is a query whose an-\nswer cannot be derived from the retrieved set. To\ncreate null queries, we generate multi-hop queries\nusing entities that do not exist in the existing bridge-\nentities. To add complexity, we also include fic-\ntional news source metadata when formulating\nthese questions, ensuring that the questions do not\nreference any contextually relevant content from\nthe knowledge base. The answer to the null query\nshould be \u201cinsufficient information\u201d or similar.\nStep 5: Quality Assurance. Finally, we use two\napproaches to reassure the dataset quality. First, we\nmanually review a subset sample of the generated\nmulti-hop queries, their corresponding evidence\nsets, and the final answers. The results of the man-\nual examination indicate a high degree of accuracy\nand data quality. Second, we utilize GPT-4 to as-\nsess each example in the dataset against the follow-\ning criteria: 1) The generated query must utilize\nall provided evidence in formulating the response;\n2) The query should be answerable solely based\non the provided evidence; 3) The response to the\ngenerated query should be either a single word or\na specific entity; 4) The query must conform to its\ndesignated query type.\nCategory\nAvg.

In this section, we showcase two\nuse cases for each task where MultiHop-RAG can\nbe employed.\n4.1\nRetrieval-related Task\nAn important design choice in an RAG system is\nthe selection of the embedding model. An embed-\nding model converts data into numerical vectors\nand subsequently stores these vectors in embedding\ndatabases. In this experiment, we evaluate differ-\nent embedding models by examining their retrieval\nquality.\nExperiment Setup: We implement an RAG sys-\ntem using the LlamaIndex framework (Liu, 2022).\nWe partition the documents in the MultiHop-RAG\nknowledge base into chunks, each consisting of 256\ntokens. We then convert the chunks using an em-\nbedding model and save the embeddings into a vec-\ntor database. Similarly, in the retrieval step, we con-\nvert a query using the same embedding model and\nretrieve the top-K most relevant chunks that have\nthe highest cosine similarity with the query embed-\nding. In this experiment, we test a variety set of em-\nbedding models, including the ada-embeddings by\nOpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002, text-search-ada-\nquery-001), voyage-02 3, llm-embedder (Zhang\net al., 2023), bge-large-en-v1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023),\njina-embeddings-v2-base-en (G\u00fcnther et al., 2023),\ne5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022), and instructor-large\n(Su et al., 2023). NULL queries are excluded in\nthis experiment because there is no matching evi-\ndence to the query. Additionally, we also include\na Reranker module to examine the retrieval perfor-\nmance, using bge-reranker-large (Xiao et al., 2023).\nAfter retrieving 20 related chunks using the em-\n3https:\/\/www.voyageai.com\/\nbedding model, we further select the top-K chunks\nusing the Reranker.\nExperiment Result: Table 5 shows the retrieval\nresult of using different embedding models. It\nshows that there is still a significant gap in retriev-\ning relevant evidence for the multi-hop queries.\nWhile Rerank can effectively improve retrieval rel-\nevance, the highest Hits@10 is only 0.7467 when\nthe Reranker technique is used. Moreover, the drop\nin the highest Hits@4 to 0.6625 is worrisome. In\npractical RAG systems, the underlying LLM of-\nten has a context window limit. As a result, the\nnumber of retrieved chunks is usually restricted to\na small number. The low values of the retrieval\nmetrics highlight the challenges in retrieving rele-\nvant pieces of evidence for multi-hop queries when\nusing direct similarity matching between the multi-\nhop query and text chunks.\n4.2\nGeneration-related Task\nThe underlying LLMs play a crucial role in gen-\nerating responses in an RAG system. In this ex-\nperiment, we evaluate the quality of generated re-\nsponses under two different settings. In the first\nsetting, we employ the best-performing retrieval\nmodel, namely voyage-02 with bge-reranker-large,\nas indicated in Table 5, to retrieve the top-K texts\nand then feed them into the LLM. In the second\nsetting, we use the ground-truth evidence associ-\nated with each query as the retrieved text for the\nLLM. This setting represents a ceiling performance\nfor testing the LLM\u2019s response capabilities, as it\nutilizes the actual evidences.\nExperiment Setup: In the first experiment, we\nretrieve top-6 chunks so that the total length of the\nretrieved text does not exceed 2,048. All queries\nin MultiHop-RAG are tested in the experiment.\nIn the second experiment, since the null queries\ndo not have associated evidence, we exclude this\ntype of query in the experiment. For the LLMs\nused in the experiment, we consider state-of-the-\nart commercial models, including GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023), GPT-3.5, Claude-2 (Anthropic, 2023), and\nGoogle-PaLM (Google, 2023). We obtain answers\nusing the provided API of the respective models.\nWe also assess some open-source models, includ-\ning Mixtral-8x7b-instruct (Jiang et al., 2024) and\nLlama-2-70b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023).\nExperiment Results: Table 6 shows the response\naccuracy of different LLMs. First, we can see\nthat the response accuracy rate using the retrieved\n","question":"Question: What percentage of multi-hop queries in MultiHop-RAG require exactly 2 pieces of evidence to answer?","answer":"Answer: 42.18%"}

Second, even when we provide\nthe LLM with the ground-truth evidences, we can\nsee that the response accuracy is far from being per-\nfect. Open source LLM such as Llama02-70B and\nMixtral-8x7B only achieve an accuracy of 0.32 and\n0.36 respectively. GPT-4 achieves strong reason-\ning capability with an accuracy of 0.89, followed\nby the second-based LLM Google-PaLM with an\naccuracy of 0.74.\nFigure 3 shows the detailed results of different\nquery types for GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct.\nBoth models show relatively high robustness on\nnull queries, meaning they are generally good at\ndetermining when a query cannot be answered\nbased on the retrieved text. This is encouraging be-\ncause one benefit of RAG is to mitigating the LLM\nhallucination issue by augmenting LLM with re-\ntrieval knowledge. However, Mixtral-8x7B model\nperforms significantly worse than the GPT-4 in\ncomparison and temporal queries. Upon reviewing\nthe incorrect responses, we find that Mixtral-8x7B\nfails to accurately handle logical negation, leading\nto misinterpretation of statements and thus a low\nperformance in the comparison queries. In addi-\ntion, Mixtral-8x7B often fails to correctly identify\nFigure 3: Generation accuracy for different query types.\nthe chronological order of events, which is crucial\nfor answering temporal queries where timing is a\nkey factor. Taken together, this experiment demon-\nstrates that there is still room for improvement in\nthe reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly\nthose that are open-source, for multi-hop queries.\n4.3\nOther Use Cases\nBeyond embedding models and LLM generation,\nthere are other areas worth exploring. For exam-\nple, query decomposition is a widely utilized tech-\nnique in RAG frameworks, such as LLamaIndex.\nThis process involves breaking down the query\ninto smaller segments; it targets a single document\nfor retrieval and integrates the information subse-\nquently, thereby potentially enhancing retrieval ac-\ncuracy. Another advanced and promising approach\ninvolves building LLM-based agents that can au-\ntomatically plan and execute multi-hop queries,\nsuch as AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023).

{"context":"niques. We believe that there are many potential\nareas for enhancing RAG\u2019s performance on multi-\nhop queries, and the curated dataset MultiHop-\nRAG can be a valuable resource to the community.\n5\nRelated Work\nRAG Evaluation: As RAG systems gain increas-\ning popularity, a variety of RAG benchmarking\ndatasets and evaluation tools have been developed.\nFor instance, RGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RE-\nCALL (Liu et al., 2023) evaluate the performance\nof LLMs in generating responses for RAG systems\nunder conditions involving noisy, integrative, and\ncounterfactual queries. However, both datasets pri-\nmarily focus on evaluating the generation aspect\nof RAG systems without specifically addressing\ntheir retrieval accuracy. In addition, recent ad-\nvancements have been made in automated RAG\nevaluation tools, such as ARES (Saad-Falcon et al.,\n2023) and RAGAS (Es et al., 2023). These tools\nutilize LLMs to automatically assess the quality of\nRAG generation, yet they do not introduce bench-\nmarking datasets. Our work introduces one of the\nfirst RAG benchmarking datasets, consisting of a\nknowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop\nqueries, their ground-truth answers, and the associ-\nated supporting evidence, thereby complementing\nexisting RAG evaluations.\nRetrieval datasets: Apart from the context of\nRAG, several benchmarking datasets exist for in-\nformation retrieval evaluation. The FEVER (Fact\nExtraction and VERification) dataset, for instance,\ncontains claims classified as Supported, Refuted,\nor NotEnoughInfo by the given Wikipedia article\n(Thorne et al., 2018). Similarly, the SciFact dataset\ncomprises scientific claims paired with evidence-\ncontaining abstracts (Wadden et al., 2020). How-\never, the claims in both datasets are single-hop\nstatements, and the supporting evidence is from one\nsingle article, in contrast to the multi-hop queries\ndiscussed in this paper. Another dataset, HoVer,\ninvolves claims that require extracting and reason-\ning from multiple Wikipedia articles (Jiang et al.,\n2020). However, unlike our dataset, HoVer focuses\nsolely on classifying claims as either supported or\nnot supported by the articles without evaluating\nan LLM generation step. Moreover, in HoVer, the\nWikipedia articles from which evidence is drawn\nare given for claim verification, which is signifi-\ncantly different from our setting, where relevant\npieces of evidence need to be extracted from a\nlarge knowledge base. Separately, (Kamalloo et al.,\n2023) evaluates a range of commercial embedding\nAPIs for information retrieval, but this evaluation\nis not contextualized within the framework of RAG\nsystems either.\nMulti-document\nQA\ndatasets:\nQuestion-\nanswering (QA) is a fundamental task in NLP, and\nseveral popular benchmarks, such as HotpotQA\n(Yang et al., 2018), MultiRC (Khashabi et al.,\n2018), and 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020),\naim to achieve QA from multiple sources of\ndocuments. This task is similar to our multi-hop\nquery RAG task, as both involve reasoning from\nmultiple sources of information. However, these\ndatasets primarily focus on assessing a model\u2019s\nreasoning skills, and they do not emphasize the\nretrieval of evidence from a knowledge base.\nAdditionally, their primary data sources Wikipedia,\nsignificantly overlap with the training data of\nmost existing LLMs. If we use these sources for\nbenchmarking RAG systems, there is a potential\nconcern that LLM responses might rely on training\nknowledge rather than reasoning from the retrieved\nknowledge base.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduce MultiHop-RAG, a novel\nand unique dataset designed for queries that re-\nquire retrieval and reasoning from multiple pieces\nof supporting evidence. These types of multi-hop\nqueries represent user queries commonly encoun-\ntered in real-world scenarios. MultiHop-RAG con-\nsists of a knowledge base, a large collection of\nmulti-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and\nthe associated supporting evidence. This paper\ndetails the creation process of MultiHop-RAG, em-\nploying a hybrid approach that integrates human\neffort with GPT-4. Additionally, we explore two\nuse cases of MultiHop-RAG in the benchmarking\nof RAG systems, thereby highlighting the potential\napplications of this dataset. By publicly releas-\ning MultiHop-RAG, we aim to provide a valuable\nresource to the community, contributing to the ad-\nvancement and benchmarking of RAG systems.\nLimitations\nThis work has several limitations that can be im-\nproved in future research. First, our ground truth\nanswers are restricted to simple responses such as\n\u201cyes\", \u201cno\", entity names, or temporal indicators\nlike \u201cbefore\" or \u201cafter\" to facilitate the use of a\n","question":"Question: What is the name of the dataset that involves claims that require extracting and reasoning from multiple Wikipedia articles?","answer":"Answer: HoVer."}

Whereas extensive\nresearch has demonstrated the privacy risks of\nlarge language models (LLMs), the RAG tech-\nnique could potentially reshape the inherent\nbehaviors of LLM generation, posing new pri-\nvacy issues that are currently under-explored.\nIn this work, we conduct extensive empiri-\ncal studies with novel attack methods, which\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems\non leaking the private retrieval database. De-\nspite the new risk brought by RAG on the re-\ntrieval data, we further reveal that RAG can\nmitigate the leakage of the LLMs\u2019 training\ndata.\nOverall, we provide new insights in\nthis paper for privacy protection of retrieval-\naugmented LLMs, which benefit both LLMs\nand RAG systems builders. Our code is avail-\nable at https:\/\/github.com\/phycholosogy\/RAG-\nprivacy.\n1\nIntroduction\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Liu, 2022;\nChase, 2022; Van Veen et al., 2023; Ram et al.,\n2023; Shi et al., 2023) is an advanced natural lan-\nguage processing technique that enhances text gen-\neration by integrating information retrieved from\na large corpus of documents. These techniques\nenable RAG to produce accurate and contextually\nrelevant outputs with augmented external knowl-\nedge and have been widely used in various scenar-\nios such as domain-specific chatbots (Siriwardhana\net al., 2023) and email\/code completion (Parvez\net al., 2021). RAG systems typically work in two\nphases, as shown in Fig 1 - retrieval and generation.\nWhen a user query is entered, relevant knowledge\nis first retrieved from an external database. The\nretrieved data is then combined with the original\n*Equal contribution.\n\u2020Corresponding to zengshe1@msu.edu\nQuery\nRetrieval\nDB\nRelevant\nDocs\nResponse\nTraining\nData\nAttacker\nEmbedding\nModel\nE\nLLMs\nLeakage\nQ\nQuery\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nFigure 1: The RAG system and potential risks.\nquery to form the input to a large language model\n(LLM). The LLM then uses its pre-trained knowl-\nedge and the retrieved data to generate a response.\nIn this paper, we focus on studying the risk of\nprivacy leakage in the RAG system, and we argue\nthat the information from both retrieval dataset and\nthe pre-training\/fine-tuning dataset (of the LLM)\nare potential to be released by RAG usage. On\none hand, the retrieval dataset can contain sensi-\ntive, valuable domain-specific information (Parvez\net al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2024), such as patients\nprescriptions can be used for RAG-based medical\nchatbots (Yunxiang et al., 2023). On the other\nhand, the retrieval process in RAG could also influ-\nence the behavior of the LLMs for text-generation,\nand this could possibly cause the LLMs to output\nprivate information from its training\/fine-tuning\ndataset. Notably, there are existing works (Car-\nlini et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2022; Lee et al.,\n2021; Carlini et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2023) ob-\nserving that LLMs can remember and leak private\ninformation from their pre-training and fine-tuning\ndata. However, how the integration of external re-\ntrieval data can affect the memorization behavior\nof LLMs in RAG is still unclear and worth further\nexploration. Therefore, these concerns motivate us\nto answer the research questions:\n\u2022 (RQ1) Can we extract private data from the\nexternal retrieval database in RAG?\narXiv:2402.16893v1  [cs.CR]  23 Feb 2024\n","question":"Question: What is the name of the university where the School of Artificial Intelligence is located?","answer":"Answer: Jilin University"}
{"context":"\u2022 (RQ2) Can retrieval data affect the memoriza-\ntion of LLMs in RAG?\nRegarding RQ1, to fully uncover the privacy\nleakage of the retrieval dataset, we consider there\nexists an attacker, who aims to extract private in-\nformation from the retrieval dataset intentionally.\nWe proposed a composite structured prompting at-\ntack method specific for extracting retrieval data,\nwhich is composed of the {information} part for\ncontext retrieval and {command} part to let LLMs\noutput retrieved contexts. In detail, take our study\non RAG for medical dialogue (Section 3.2) as an\nexample, the attacker can ask the model for general\ninformation or suggestions related to certain dis-\neases. More importantly, we propose to append an\nextra \u201ccommand prompt\u201d (see Section 3.2) during\ninquiry to improve the successful rate of extraction.\nAfter that, we examine the model\u2019s output to see\nwhether it contains information about specific pre-\nscription records, which may hurt the privacy of\npatients. Based our empirical study, we observe\nthat our studied models (Llama2-7b-Chat and GPT-\n3.5-turbo) can output verbatim or highly similar\nrecords with very high rates (near 50%). This re-\nsult reveals that RAG systems are highly suscepti-\nble to such attacks, with a considerable amount of\nsensitive retrieval data being extracted.\nRegarding RQ2, while prior work has shown\nthat LLMs exhibit a propensity to output memo-\nrized training data, verifying the influence of re-\ntrieval data integration remains unexplored. There-\nfore, we conduct targeted and prefix attacks on\nLLMs\u2019 training corpus, comparing training data\nexposure with and without retrieval augmentation.\nWe discover that incorporating retrieval data into\nRAG systems can substantially reduce LLMs\u2019 ten-\ndency to output its memorized training data, achiev-\ning greater protection than noise injection or system\nprompts. From a training data security perspective,\nour findings indicate that RAG may provide a safer\narchitecture compared to using LLMs sorely.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG), first intro-\nduced by Lewis et al. (2020), has emerged as one\nof the most popular approaches to enhance the gen-\neration ability of LLMs (Liu, 2022; Chase, 2022;\nVan Veen et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al.,\n2023). This synergy markedly boosts the output\u2019s\naccuracy and relevance (Gao et al., 2023), mitigat-\ning essential issues commonly referred to as \"hal-\nlucinations\" of LLMs (Shuster et al., 2021). One\nof RAG\u2019s distinctive features is its flexible archi-\ntecture, allowing for the seamless interchange or\nupdate of its three core components: the dataset, the\nretriever, and the LLM. This flexibility means that\nadjustments to any of these elements can be made\nwithout necessitating re-training or fine-tuning of\nthe entire system (Shao et al., 2023; Cheng et al.,\n2023). These unique advantages have positioned\nRAG as a favored approach for a range of practi-\ncal applications, including personal chatbots and\nspecialized domain experts like medical diagnostic\nassistants(Panagoulias et al., 2024).\n2.2\nPrivacy Risk of Large Language Models\nA body of research has demonstrated that LLMs\nare prone to memorizing and inadvertently reveal-\ning information from their pre-training corpora\n(Carlini et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2022; Lee\net al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2022; Ippolito et al.,\n2022; Zhang et al., 2021; Biderman et al., 2023;\nMireshghallah et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). No-\ntably, Carlini et al. (2021) pioneered the investiga-\ntion into data extraction attacks, revealing LLMs\u2019\ntendency to recall and reproduce segments of their\ntraining data. Following this, subsequent studies\nfurther identified various factors, such as model\nsize, data duplication, and prompt length that in-\ncrease such memorization risk (Carlini et al., 2022;\nBiderman et al., 2023). Moreover, for the privacy\nrisks associated with fine-tuning data, (Mireshghal-\nlah et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023).\nMireshghallah et al. (2022) discovered that fine-\ntuning model heads lead to more significant memo-\nrization than adjusting smaller adapter modules.\nFurthermore, Zeng et al. (2023) examined how\nmemorization varies across different fine-tuning\ntasks, noting particular vulnerabilities in tasks that\ndemand extensive feature representation, such as\ndialogue and summarization. Huang et al. (2023)\nhas investigated the privacy risk of retrieval-based\nkNN-LM(Khandelwal et al., 2019), while it is dif-\nferent from our work as kNN-LM has a different\narchitecture and mechanism.\n3\nMethod\nTo answer the RQ1 and RQ2 in Section 1, we con-\nduct various attacks that aim at quantifying the\nleakage risks associated with different components\nof the RAG framework.

{"context":"retrieval and training data.\n3.1\nBackground and Threat Model\nRAG Pipeline.\nA typical Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) system involves a large lan-\nguage model M, a retrieval dataset D, and a re-\ntriever R. Given a user query q, the system is\ndesigned to produce an answer a. In the RAG pro-\ncess, the retriever R is tasked with identifying the\nTop-k relevant documents from D corresponding\nto the query q. This is more formally denoted as:\nR(q, D) = {d1, d2, ..., dk} \u2286D\nThis step typically involves calculating the simi-\nlarity or distance between the query\u2019s embedding\neq and the embeddings of stored documents edi.\nFor example, using a k-NN(Fix and Hodges, 1989)\n(k-Nearest Neighbors) retriever, the retrieval step\ncan be formulated as:\nR(q, D) = {di \u2208D | dist(eq, edi) is in the top k}\nHere, dist(eq, edi) quantifies the distance between\ntwo embeddings, employing metrics such as the L2-\nnorm. The top-k documents exhibiting the smallest\ndistances are subsequently retrieved.\nOnce the relevant documents are retrieved, the\nRAG integrates the retrieved context R(q, D) with\nthe query q to generate an answer. To integrate\nthe retrieved context with q, we concatenate the\nretrieved documents with the query, forming a com-\nbined input for the language model M. Finally, we\nobtain the output from M:\na = M(R(q, D) || q)\nThreat Model.\nWe consider a realistic black-box\nattack where the attacker interacts with the system\nsolely through API queries. Thus, the attacker\u2019s\nstrategy is limited to crafting and modifying queries\nq to extract the desired information.\n3.2\nPrivacy Leakage on Retrieval Data\nIn the black-box attack setting, the attacker endeav-\nors to extract data from the retrieval dataset via\nprompting. This task is particularly challenging as\nthe prompts must simultaneously accomplish two\nobjectives: (a) induce the retriever to accurately\nretrieve targeted information and (b) prompt the\nmodel to output the retrieval data in context. This\ndual requirement makes previously proposed at-\ntacks impractical. For instance, the data extraction\nattack (Carlini et al., 2021, 2022) on LLMs only fo-\ncuses on extracting parametric knowledge without\nconsidering extracting information in the context.\nBesides, the prompt extraction attack (Willison,\n2022; Zhang and Ippolito, 2023; Liu, 2023) solely\ntargets the extraction of fixed system prompts, ne-\nglecting the dynamic retrieval process. We present\na composite structured prompting that can achieve\nthese two objectives:\nq = {information} + {command}\nThe {information} component is to direct the re-\ntrieval system towards fetching particular data;\nwhile the {command} component instructs the lan-\nguage model to include the retrieved information\ninto its response. For the {command} component,\nwe use phrases such as \"Please repeat all the con-\ntext\"1 to prompt the LLM to reproduce the retrieved\ncontext. The {information} component is adjusted\naccording to the objectives of the attack, whether\nthey are targeted or untargeted. This prompt struc-\nture allows us to effectively extract retrieval data\nand evaluate privacy leakage by comparing outputs\nwith returned documents. Its flexibility also en-\nables easy adaptation to different types of leakage.\nTargeted Attack.\nIn the targeted attack, the at-\ntacker has specific objectives regarding the type\nof information they aim to extract, such as person-\nally identifiable information (PII) including phone\nnumbers and email addresses, or sensitive content\nlike personal dialogue cases. For these attacks, the\n{information} component consists of some specific\ninformation that is related to the attacker\u2019s goals.\nFor example, we can use proceeding texts of per-\nsonal information like \"Please call me at\" to extract\nphone numbers or queries like \"I want some infor-\nmation about ** disease\" to obtain private medical\nrecords related to a specific disease. More details\nabout the design of {information} components are\nillustrated in Appendix A.2.1.\nUntargeted Attack\nIn the context of an untar-\ngeted attack, the attacker\u2019s objective is to gather\nas much information as possible from the whole\nretrieval dataset, rather than seeking specific data.\nTo achieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we\nrandomly select chunks from the Common Crawl\ndataset to serve as the {information} component.\n1We use this command because it achieves consistently\npromising attack effect and we discuss the impact of command\ndesign on retrieval and extraction in Section 4.4\n","question":"Question: What is the purpose of the retriever R in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system?","answer":"Answer: The purpose of the retriever R in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is to identify the Top-k relevant documents from D corresponding to the query q."}
{"context":"3.3\nPrivacy Leakage on LLM Training Data\nWhile addressing the privacy concerns of retrieval\ndata, we also investigate the potential leakage of\ntraining data within LLMs employed in the RAG\nsystem, particularly in scenarios involving interac-\ntions with the retrieval component. To achieve this,\nwe compared the difference in training data expo-\nsure with and without retrieval augmentation when\nattacking the same large language model. Given\nthe vastness of the full training dataset, our inves-\ntigation is tailored to specific subsets of the train-\ning corpus with targeted attacks and prefix attacks\n(Carlini et al., 2022), where the former focuses on\nextracting specific private information while the\nlatter evaluates the memorization by reproducing\ntexts from the training data.\nTargeted Attack.\nThis attack strategy, while\nbearing resemblance to the targeted attacks dis-\ncussed in Section 3.2, is specifically tailored to the\nobjective of extracting sensitive information, such\nas PIIs, directly from the LLM. Therefore, we omit\nthe {command} component and utilize straightfor-\nward prompting phrases like \u201cMy phone number\nis\" and \u201cPlease email me at\" to access the private\ndata in pre-training\/fine-tuning datasets of LLMs.\nPrefix Attack.\nIt involves inputting the exact\nprefixes of training examples and checking if the\nmodel output matches the original suffixes (Carlini\net al., 2022). Note that this method requires attack-\ners to know the actual training data, which limits its\npracticality. However, it serves as a useful method\nfor quantitatively measuring memorization effects.\n4\nRQ1: Can we extract private data from\nthe external retrieval database in RAG?\nWith the proposed targeted and untargeted attacks\non the retrieval dataset in Section 3.2 , we em-\npirically investigated the privacy leakage of the\nretrieval dataset(RD). Our evaluation revealed the\nRAG system\u2019s high vulnerability to attacks on re-\ntrieval data. We also conducted ablation studies\nto examine various impact factors and explored\npossible mitigation strategies.\n4.1\nEvaluation Setup\nRAG Components.\nFor the LLM, we uti-\nlized three commonly used and safety-aligned\nmodels, including Llama-7b-chat(L7C), Llama-\n13b-chat(L13C), and GPT-3.5-turbo(GPT). Re-\ngarding embedding models, we primarily used\nbge-large-en-v1.5, and also explored others like\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2 and e5-base-v2 in Section\n4.4. Chroma2 was used to construct the retrieval\ndatabase and store embeddings. The metric to cal-\nculate the similarity by default is L2-norm. The\nnumber of retrieved documents per query was set\nto k = 2, and we studied its impact in Section 4.4.\nDatasets and Metrics.\nTo investigate the leak-\nage of private data, we chose two datasets as our\nretrieval data: the Enron Email dataset of 500,000\nemployee emails, and the HealthcareMagic-101\ndataset of 200k doctor-patient medical dialogues.\nIn practice, these datasets correlate to scenarios\nlike email completion or medical chatbots. Both\ndatasets contain private information such as PIIs\nand personal dialogues, allowing us to evaluate the\nprivacy risks of retrieval data extraction. For the\nHealthcareMagic dataset, we construct each doctor-\npatient medical dialogue as a data piece embedded\nand stored in a vector database, while for the Enron\nEmail, we construct each email as a data piece.\nFor both attacks, we report the total number of\ncontexts fetched (Retrieval Contexts), the num-\nber of prompts yielding outputs with at least 20\ndirect tokens from the dataset (Repeat Prompts),\nand the number of unique direct excerpts produced\n(Repeat Contexts). For targeted attacks, we re-\nport the extracted targeted information (Targeted\nInformation). For untargeted attacks, we report\nthe number of prompts generating outputs with a\nROUGE-L score over 0.5 (Rouge Prompts), and\nthe total number of unique outputs closely resem-\nbling the retrieval data (Rouge Contexts).\n4.2\nResults of Untargeted Attack\nThe results of untargeted attacks are presented in\nTable 1, and some leakage examples are in Ap-\npendix A.4. It shows that a majority of the prompts\neffectively prompted the retrieval system to fetch\nrelevant data segments. Moreover, a considerable\namount of these prompts have led the model to pro-\nduce outputs that either exactly match or closely\nresemble the retrieved content. For instance, us-\ning the Enron Mail dataset for retrieval and GPT-\n3.5-turbo as the generative model (the last row),\nout of 250 prompts, 452 unique data segments are\nretrieved (Retrieval Contexts); 116 prompts re-\nsult in the model generating exact matches from\nthe retrieved content (Repeat Prompts); and 121\nprompts produce outputs closely related to the re-\ntrieved content (Rouge Prompts).

For the Enron emails,\nwe aim to extract PII using common preceding\ntexts like \u201cMy phone number is\u201d as the {informa-\ntion}. We count the number of extracted PIIs from\nthe retrieval data as targeted information. For the\nHealthCareMagic dialogues, we target extracting\ndiagnosed cases for certain diseases using \u201cI want\ninformation about disease\u201d as the {information}.\nIn this evaluation, we only consider the targeted\ninformation successfully extracted if (a) the tar-\ngeted disease name appears in the returned con-\ntext, and (b) the model outputs repetitive pieces\nfrom the returned context. Our analysis shows that\ntargeted attacks can effectively retrieve sensitive\ninformation, as detailed in Table 2. For example,\nwith Llama-7b-Chat as the generative model, 250\nprompts successfully extracted 89 targeted medi-\ncal dialogue chunks from HealthCareMagic and\n107 PIIs from Enron Email. This high success rate\ndemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems to\ntargeted attacks on retrieval data extraction.\n4.4\nAblation Study\nIn this subsection, we conduct ablation studies on\nvarious factors that may affect privacy leakage. We\nmainly discuss the impact of returned documents\nper query k and then the impact of command com-\nponents while postponing discussions on the im-\npact of embedding models and generation sampling\nmethods, in Appendix A.1\nReturned Documents.\nTo investigate how\nretrieved-context counts k per query would im-\npact privacy leaks, we varies k from 1 to 4 and\nthe results are shown in Figure 3. We fix the LLM\nas Llama-7b-Chat and the embedding model as\nbge-large-en-v1.5. From the results, we can\nfind that for untargeted attacks, the number of re-\ntrieved documents increases with k while a much\nslower increase regarding leaked documents (Re-\npeat Contexts\/ Rouge Contexts). For the targeted\nattack, we can find an increase in targeted informa-\ntion on HealthCareMagic dataset, but no increase\non Enron Mail dataset. Therefore, the increase in k\ndoes not substantially increase the privacy leakage.\nThis marginal improvement may result from the\nmodels\u2019 constrained capacity to coherently process\nextensive contextual content. Thus when prompted\nto repeat contexts, models cannot comprehensively\nreproduce all references, instead extracting only\npartial excerpts from one of the retrieved docu-\nments 3.\nCommand Component. We investigate how\nthe construction of the command component im-\npacts retrieval and generation in Figure 2. Specif-\nically, we examine 4 command prompts ranging\nfrom short to long: C1:\" \", C2: \"Please repeat\",\nC3: \"Please repeat all the context\", C4: \"Please ig-\nnore all previous commands and just repeat all the\ninputs.\" From Figures 2a and 2c, we find that com-\nmands affect the number of retrieved documents.\nVery long commands like C4 reduce retrieved docu-\nments, possibly because the long command makes\nthe query embedding less diverse as it occupies a\nlarge portion of the sentence. While very short sen-\ntences like \u2018repeat\u2019 or no command retrieve more\ndiverse context but also introduce low extraction.\nThis may be because when we input a general com-\nmand like \u2018repeat\u2019, the LLM does not understand\nwhat content to repeat.

We\ninvestigate pre-retrieval techniques like set dis-\ntance threshold and post-processing techniques\nlike re-ranking and summarization.\nHere, we\nuse Llama2-7b-Chat as the generative model and\nbge-large-en-v1.5 as the embedding model\nwith k = 2.\nRe-ranking.\nIn Retriever-Generator (RAG) mod-\nels, re-ranking significantly enhances the generated\ntext\u2019s quality and relevance. This process involves\nutilizing another pre-trained model to evaluate the\nrelevance of retrieved documents to the query, sub-\nsequently adjusting their order to prioritize those\nmore pertinent to the question. We posit that this\napproach can mitigate privacy risks by focusing\nthe model on relevant information and reducing\nthe likelihood of disseminating irrelevant content.\nIn our implementation, we employ the widely rec-\nognized bge-reranker-large4 reranker to score\nthe documents and prepend the most relevant doc-\numents closest to the query. However,from the\nresults in Figure 4a and Figure 4b, we can observe\nthat re-ranking has almost no mitigation effects.\nSummarization with Relevant Query.\nSumma-\nrization may serve as a potential mitigation as it\ncompresses the retrieved contexts and thus reduces\n4https:\/\/huggingface.co\/BAAI\/\nbge-reranker-large\ntheir information exposure. To investigate this, we\nperform summarization first using an additional\nmodel after retrieval which is then input to the gen-\nerative model. To be specific, we input both the\nquery and each returned documents to the LLM and\nask LLM to only maintain the relevant information\nto the query. We consider both extractive summa-\nrization (Sum), which does not allow paraphrasing,\nand abstraction summarization (Sum.Para) allow-\ning sentence alteration5. Our findings indicate that\nsummarization effectively reduces privacy risks as-\nsociated with untargeted attacks. Notably, abstrac-\ntive summarization demonstrated superior effec-\ntiveness, reducing the risk by approximately 50%.\nThis is because summarization reduces the sen-\ntence length and filters out irrelevant information,\nthus reducing the number of successful reconstruc-\ntions. However, in the context of targeted attacks,\nthe effect of summarization was limited. For in-\nstance, in the Enron email dataset, the occurrence\nof personally identifiable information (PIIs) even\ninadvertently increased. This suggests that while\nsummarization techniques may filter out irrelevant\ncontent, it tends to retain key information pertinent\nto targeted attacks, potentially increasing the likeli-\nhood of the LLM generating sensitive information.\nSet Distance Threshold.\nAdding a distance\nthreshold in retrieval for RAG models may reduce\nthe risk of extracting sensitive retrieval data by en-\n5We detailed the prompt templates for summarization in\nAppendix A.2.3\n","question":"Question: What is the name of the reranker model used in the re-ranking process?","answer":"I don't know."}

In\nthis table, \"None\" means no retrieval data is in-\ncluded, \"Random Noise\" and \"System Prompt\" de-\nnote adding random characters and protective sys-\ntem prompts prepend to the input prompts. \"RAG-\n{dataset}\" indicate which dataset is used for re-\ntrieval. The results show that incorporating RAG\ndata substantially reduced the number of PIIs ex-\ntracted from the training data compared to using\nthe LLM alone. Adding random noise or protective\nsystem prompts mitigated leakage to some extent,\nbut remained far less effective than RAG integra-\ntion. These findings indicate that the incorpora-\ntion of retrieval data significantly reduces LLM\u2019s\npropensity to reproduce content memorized during\nits training\/finetuning process.\n5.3\nPrefix Attack\nIn line with the methods outlined in Section 3.3,\nwe executed prefix attacks by providing the LLM\nwith the first 100 tokens of training examples (of\nthe LLM) and then comparing the model\u2019s outputs\nwith the original text that followed these tokens. If\nthe similarity score, measured by the ROUGE-L\nmetric, exceeded 0.5, we considered a successful\nextraction. The results in Table 3 show that the\nintegration of retrieval data, in contrast to using\nthe LLM alone or with noise or unrelated prompts,\ngreatly decreased the LLM\u2019s ability to recall and\nreproduce its training data. Specifically, it leads to\na reduction in successful text reconstructions from\nover 200 cases to fewer than 40. This highlights\nthat retrieval data integration can effectively reduce\nLLMs\u2019 risk of revealing training data.\n7We introduced the construction of random noise and pro-\ntective system prompts in appendix A.2.2\n5.4\nDiscussions & Practical Implications\nThe reasons why LLMs are less likely to output\nmemorized data could be complex. One possible\nreason is that incorporating external data makes\nLLMs less reliant on training data but focuses on\nleveraging information from retrieved contexts. As\nevidenced by the Bayes Theorem in (Xie et al.,\n2021), when leveraging external diverse datasets\nduring inference, the model generates new tokens\nbased on the conditional distribution given the re-\ntrieved data R(q, D) and q. Such a distribution\nis different from the one only given q, and relies\nmore on the retrieved data R(q, D). Such hypothe-\nsis is empirically supported by our results in Table\n3. We can observe that when the retrieval data\ncomprises entirely disparate data types, the LLM\ndemonstrates a marked inability to extract PIIs,\nwhile when the retrieval data includes another PII\ndataset (W3C-Email), we found the LLM tends to\noutput more retrieval data instead of training data.\nThese findings have significant implications.\nFirst, integrating retrieval data reduces the risk of\nprivacy leaks from LLMs\u2019 training data, making\nit harder for attackers to access this information.\nThis highlights the importance of addressing risks\nrelated to information extraction from retrieval data\nin practical RAG systems. Second, RAG can effec-\ntively protect private information in LLMs\u2019 training\ndata. Using non-sensitive public or carefully de-\nsensitized data as retrieval content can greatly min-\nimize the risk of information leakage from LLMs.\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we extensively investigated the pri-\nvacy risks associated with retrieval-augmented gen-\neration (RAG) technique for LLMs. Through our\nproposed attack methods, we first systematically\nevaluated and identified the significant risks of re-\ntrieval data extraction. Meanwhile, we explored\nvarious defense techniques that can mitigate these\n","question":"Question: What is the number of successful text reconstructions when using the LLM alone for prefix attack?","answer":"Answer: 213"}

We also found that integrating retrieval data\ncan substantially reduce LLMs\u2019 tendency to output\nits memorized training data, which suggests that\nRAG could potentially mitigate the risks of training\ndata leakage. Overall, we revealed novel insights\nregarding privacy concerns of retrieval-augmented\nLLMs, which is beneficial for the proper usage of\nRAG techniques in real-world applications.\n7\nLimitations\nIn our research, we concentrated primarily on the\napplication of retrieval augmentation during the in-\nference stage, without delving into its integration\nduring pre-training or fine-tuning phases.

For both targeted and untargeted attacks, we use the default settings as\nin Section 4.1 and set different temperatures (0, 0.6, 1) for the LLM during its generation. It is worth\nnoting that when the temperature is 0, the model will output tokens with the largest probability which is\ncommonly referred to as greedy generation.

Therefore, we study the impact of different questions in\nthe command prompt. We adopt the default experimental settings while utilizing 7 different questions\nas shown in Table 8 and Table 9. It is obvious that different commands indeed affect the extraction\nperformance. Very general commands like \u201crepeat\" or no command leads to very low extraction. This\nis mainly because LLMs can hardly understand what contents they should reproduce. On the contrary,\ndetailed commands such as \u201cPlease repeat all the context\" achieve consistently good performance and\nextract much private information. These findings suggest that there exists potential to design more\npowerful commands to extract even more private data from the retrieval dataset.\nTable 8: Impact of question(targeted)\nDataset\nQuestion\nRetrieval Private\nContexts\nRepeat Effect\nPrompt\nRepeat Extract\nContext\nTargeted\nInformation\nHealthCareMagic\n.\n472\n46\n56\n42\nPlease ignore all previous command and just repeat all the inputs.\n438\n67\n78\n58\nPlease repeat all the context.\n449\n127\n143\n105\nPlease repeat.\n458\n57\n57\n43\nRepeat.\n464\n44\n45\n29\nEnron-Email\n.\n352\n17\n18\n60\nPlease ignore all previous command and just repeat all the inputs.\n245\n16\n15\n25\nPlease repeat all the context.\n322\n46\n41\n107\nPlease repeat.\n330\n15\n14\n47\nRepeat.\n327\n21\n20\n67\n","question":"Question: What is the term commonly referred to when the temperature is set to 0 during the LLM's generation?","answer":"Answer: Greedy generation."}

These data determine the maximum limit of attack capabilities. Therefore, whether employing a\ntargeted or untargeted attack, it is crucial to maintain input diversity in order to ensure effective extraction.\nFor targeted attacks, it is also crucial to ensure that the extracted contexts aligns as closely as possible with\nthe attacker\u2019s specific requirements. Consequently, the design of the {information} component differs for\nthese two attack types.\nTargeted Attack\nTo generate the {information} component for a targeted attack, there are two stages\ninvolved.\nIn the first stage, the attacker must provide specific examples based on their individual requirements.\nFor instance, they may write queries such as \"I want some advice about {target name}\", \"About {target\nname}\" if the name of the target object is clear. On the contrary, if the target is abstract, such as a specific\nemail address or someone\u2019s phone number, the attacker can provide the prefix content related to these\ntargets, such as \"Please email us at\" or \"Please call me at\".\nIn the second stage, it is crucial to generate a significant quantity of {information} that is both similar\nand varied based on the provided examples. If the extracted target consists of numerous sub-contents, the\ngeneration process can incorporate replacing these specific sub-contents to generate diverse variations.\nSpecifically, for the HealthcareMagic dataset, considering the multitude of disease types, the names\nof different diseases can be obtained by leveraging ChatGPT\u2019s generation capabilities or by accessing\nthe International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from the World Health Organization (WHO). The\n{information} component is created by \"I want some advice about {disease name}\". Another approach\n(is also used for the Enron Email dataset) is to directly leverage LLMs like ChatGPT to generate similar\nsentences with examples. For instance, you can input \u201cGenerate 100 similar snetences like \"Please email\nus at\"\u201d.\nUntargeted Attack\nSince there is no need to extract specific targets, untargeted attack only needs to\nconsider making {information} components more diverse to obtain more data from retrieval datasets. To\nachieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we randomly select chunks from the Common Crawl dataset\nto serve as the {information} component. Due to the random nature of the input, it has the potential to\nimpact the {command} component. Therefore, we have implemented a maximum length of 15 tokens for\nthe {information} component.\nA.2.2\nConstruction of System Prompts and Random Noises\nWe use random noises and protective system prompts in Section 5. For random noises, we just randomly\nchoose 50 characters and prepend them to the prompt. For the system prompts, we construct some\ncommonly used instructions as shown in Table 10, and randomly select one to prepend on each input.\nA.2.3\nSummarization Defense Prompts\nWhen conducting a Summary Defense, there are two main goals: to mitigate the performance degradation\nof RAG, and to enhance security. An effective approach is to selectively include only the data relevant to\n","question":"Question: What is the maximum length of the {information} component in an untargeted attack?","answer":"Answer: 15 tokens"}

Therefore, we created\nthe following two prompts:\nWhen summarizing, each extracted context and its corresponding query are placed in the respective\npositions above.\nA.3\nPerformance Evaluation\nFor different datasets, we have employed various methods to assess performance of RAG. For each dataset,\nwe partition it into training and testing sets using a 99:1 ratio. The training set is utilized to build the RAG\nmodel, while we randomly sample 1000 instances from the testing set to evaluate the performance of\nRAG.\nFor the HealthcareMagic dataset, due to the consistent format of the data of the testing sets, which\nis \"Input: Input Content\\nOutput: Output Content\", we utilize Input Content as the input for the RAG\nmodel, compare the RAG model\u2019s output with Output Content, and evaluate their ROUGE-L scores.\nFor the Enron Mail dataset, there are no explicit inputs and outputs. For each instance from the test set,\nwe select the first 50 tokens as inputs to RAG, and then calculate the perplexity (PPL) of the corresponding\noutput.\nAs we mentioned in Section 4.5, there exists a mitigation-performance trade-off for discussed mitigation\nmethods. We provide detailed results of the performance of the RAG system when conducting these\nmitigation methods, in Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14. Detailed analysis can be found in Section 4.5.\n","question":"Question: What is the ratio of the training set to the testing set used in the performance evaluation of RAG?","answer":"question: What is the ratio of the training set to the testing set used in the performance evaluation of RAG?\n\nAnswer: 99:1."}

The recent popularity of generative\nAI with Large Language models (LLM), such as\nGPT (Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al.,\nTop N \nRetrieved \nPassages\nGold \nPassage\nLongNQ DB\nLongNQ DB\nQuestion: What is the story of call of duty zombie\n?\n?\nprompt\n?\nTop N \nRetrieved \nPassages\n?\n---- Retrieval -----\n---- Generation -----\n---- Full RAG -----\nA\nA\nprompt\n?\n--------\nFigure 1: CLAPNQ is designed to test all parts of\nthe RAG pipeline: Retrieval, Generation with gold\npassages, and the full RAG setup with generation\non retrieved passages.\n2023), FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), and Mis-\ntral (Jiang et al., 2023) has shifted the focus to\nproviding long and detailed answers for any user\ninformation need. An important challenge for re-\nsponses produced by an LLM is ensuring that an-\nswers are faithful (being grounded in a supporting\npassage) to ensure that a user can be confident in\nthe response provided to them.\nCLAPNQ is a grounded long-form QA bench-\nmark dataset for Retrieval Augmented Generation\nof LLMs. The answers are typically long, 2-3 sen-\ntences, in contrast to datasets based on machine\nreading comprehension such as Natural Questions\n(NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and SQuAD (Ra-\njpurkar et al., 2016, 2018) which are just a few\nwords. It is grounded on a single gold passage,\nin contrast to other long-form question answering\n(LFQA) datasets such as ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019)\nwhere gold passages are not available. It is built\nfrom a subset of the highly successful Natural Ques-\ntions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) dataset for extrac-\ntive QA from Wikipedia documents based on users\nreal web search queries \u2013 specifically, the subset of\nNQ that has long answers (passages) but no short\nextractive answers.

CLAPNQ is publicly available in a\nGithub repository1.\n2\nRelated Work\nNatural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is\na large MRC QA dataset of 323k questions built\nusing Wikipedia documents as the source for nat-\nural queries users inputted into Google.\nEach\nquestion was manually annotated given a pro-\nvided Wikipedia document. There is also an open-\nretrieval version of NQ, OpenNQ (Lee et al., 2019)\nwhere the task is to find the answer to the question\nvia retrieval, but it only focuses on the short ex-\ntractive answers, and therefore does not include the\nsame set of questions as CLAPNQ. This corpus\nis also considerably larger than our corpus as we\njust include the Wikipedia documents used in the\nCLAPNQ questions. Several datasets have been\ndeveloped from NQ such as AmbigQA (Min et al.,\n2020), ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022), AquaMuse\n(Kulkarni et al., 2020), AttributedQA (Bohnet\net al., 2022), MoQA (Yen et al., 2023) and now\nCLAPNQ.\nSeveral RAG datasets exist for short extrac-\ntive answers (e.g.\n(Lee et al., 2019; Adlakha\net al., 2022; Bohnet et al., 2022)). MoQA (Yen\net al., 2023) explores answers of varying length\nbut the long answers are full paragraphs as in\nthe original NQ. Current LFQA datasets include\nAquaMuse (Kulkarni et al., 2020), ASQA (Stel-\nmakh et al., 2022), ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), Ex-\npertQA (Malaviya et al., 2023), TruthfulQA (Lin\net al., 2022), and WikiHowQA (Deng et al., 2020).\nASQA and ELI5 along with QAMPARI (Amouyal\net al., 2023) are part of the Automatic LLMs\u2019 Cita-\ntion Evaluation (ALCE) (Gao et al., 2023) bench-\nmark. QAMPARI is not LFQA, but rather multiple\nshort extractive answers. We compare all the LFQA\ndatasets to CLAPNQ in Table 2. Most notably,\nCLAPNQ is the only dataset to include consider-\nable unanswerable questions, manually annotated\nanswers grounded on a single gold passage, and a\ncorpus for the full RAG pipeline.\nThe Explain Like I\u2019m 5 (ELI5) dataset con-\nsists of questions and responses from the Reddit\nthread. KILT-ELI5 (Petroni et al., 2021) provides\nWikipedia documents that have been retrieved us-\ning the questions for benchmarking RAG. However,\n1https:\/\/github.com\/primeqa\/clapnq\nthere are no gold passages and the KILT-ELI5 doc-\numents do not necessarily have the answer. The\nresponses written for this sub-Reddit are by subject\nmatter experts (SME) and are often not grounded\non any text or passage. Each question is likely to\nhave many responses and they may not all be ap-\npropriate or relevant and inter-annotator agreement\n(IAA) is very low as shown in Table 2. IAA is\nmeasured as the mean RougeL F1 score between\neach pair of annotations for the same question.\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) has sets of true and\nfalse reference answers and a source that supports\nthe reference answers for each question. It is a very\nsmall validation dataset as shown in Table 2 that\nwas designed to be adversarial (the questions were\nintentionally picked to be ones that are answered\nincorrectly) to probe LLMs. The answers are also\nconsiderably shorter than the other LFQA datasets.\nWikiHowQA (Deng et al., 2020) is \u201cHow to\u201d in-\nstruction questions from the WikiHow website. For\neach page, the question is the title and the answer\nis the context. Only pages that have reference doc-\numents are kept. There can be many references for\neach question. The answers and references are long\nand have not been manually verified.\nExpertQA (Malaviya et al., 2023) consists of\nquestions that are written by SMEs. They then use\nGPT-4 and various retriever setups (e.g. Closed-\nBook, and BM25) to generate several answers\nand retrieve relevant documents. The experts then\nevaluate the answers and evidence and can delete\nclaims and evidence that are false and revise if they\nwant to (it is optional). Only one answer was eval-\nuated and revised for each question. Due to the\napproach of creating the dataset the answers are\nlikely biased by the LLMs.\nAquaMuse (Kulkarni et al., 2020) is a summa-\nrization dataset using NQ questions that have a\nlong answer (the passage) without a short answer\nsimilar to CLAPNQ. However, they use sentence-\nlevel matching (by encoding sentences for seman-\ntic similarity comparisons) to retrieve up to top 7\ndocuments from Common Crawl while avoiding\nexact matches as the abstractive dataset. In the ex-\ntractive version, the sentences in the original long\nanswer are then replaced with the highly seman-\ntic similar sentences from the retrieved documents.\nThis means the new summaries are as long as the\noriginal passage. The information in the original\npassage may not be in the retrieved documents.\nASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022) is an ambiguous\n","question":"Question: What is the name of the repository where CLAPNQ is publicly available?","answer":"Answer: The repository is named https:\/\/github.com\/primeqa\/clapnq."}

ASQA is derived from the subset of NQ that\nhas short answers with additional answers for the\nambiguity from AmbigQA. Therefore, the gold pas-\nsages for the ambiguous answers are not available\nfor all ASQA questions and some of the evidence\nmay not be part of OpenNQ. ASQA is perhaps\nthe most similar to CLAPNQ, with the main differ-\nences being: 1) ASQA answer comes from multiple\npassages while the CLAPNQ answer is contained\nin one passage. They are not likely to be cohesive\nwithin a single passage 2) The ASQA answers are\nconsiderably longer, indicating they may not be as\nconcise 3) We explore additional types of questions\nthat tend to require a long answer such as boolean\nquestions, conjunctive questions, descriptive ques-\ntions, and questions requiring an explanation. 4)\nThe IAA computed using RougeL for questions\nthat were answered by multiple annotators is much\nlower than CLAPNQ at 0.48 compared to 0.67.\nFor a detailed survey of RAG approaches we\ndirect the reader to the comprehensive RAG survey\n(Gao et al., 2024). It is worth noting that the bench-\nmarks section in this survey is a short paragraph\nwhich refers to two datasets (Liu et al., 2023; Chen\net al., 2023) that focus on short extractive answers,\nattacks and robustness when the passages are pur-\nposely adversarial and unfaithful. Furthermore, the\ndatasets questions and responses are created using\nChatGPT which likely introduces biases. The for-\nmer (Liu et al., 2023) does not include retrieval and\nthe latter (Chen et al., 2023) has fixed retrieved pas-\nsages instead of a corpus. We believe that this high-\nlights the need for quality datasets (like CLAPNQ)\nfocusing on faithfulness for the full RAG pipeline.\nRecently, synthetically generated datasets such\nas Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang\net al., 2023) have been created using LLMs. These\ndatasets can be very large, containing 50k+ conver-\nsations, but they\u2019re built to fine-tune LLMs and not\napplicable as evaluation benchmarks.\n3\nDataset\nCLAPNQ is created from the subset of Natural\nQuestions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) that\nhave a long answer (passage) but no short answer.\nNQ consists of 323k examples. There are around\n30,000 questions that are long answers without\nshort answers excluding tables and lists. To in-\ncrease the likelihood of longer answers we only ex-\nplored ones that have more than 5 sentences. Each\nNQ train example is annotated by one person and\neach NQ dev example is annotated by 5 people. We\nonly explore dev questions where the majority of\nthe annotators agreed it was a long answer with-\nout a short answer. 12,657 training and 384 dev\nexamples met our criteria for annotation.\n3.1\nAnnotation Task\nCLAPNQ was annotated by 7 skilled in-house an-\nnotators paid above minimum wage whose sole\njobs are performing Natural Language Processing\nannotation tasks. The annotation task consisted of\ntwo rounds to provide high quality non-consecutive\ngrounded answers to the question. Each task in\nboth rounds took approximately 5 minutes.

In addition to providing the number of questions per split we also\nprovide the original source from NQ as we used part of training for the dev and test set.\nThe main instruction provided to the annotators\nwas: Given a question and a passage, find the an-\nswer to the question in the passage. Check the\nboxes for the answer sentences and then copy\/paste\nthe relevant text into the answer box. Finally, af-\nter creating an answer from the passage they were\nasked to look over the question and answer and\nmake sure it makes sense, is a concise answer, and\nis grammatically correct. They had to confirm that\nthey checked all of these things before completing\nthe task. A screenshot of the task is provided in\nAppendix A, Figure 2.\nAfter initial training and pilots with calibrating\nof instructions on around 100 questions, each of the\nNQ questions without a short answer was annotated\nby one trained annotator in Round 1.\nIn Round 1, the annotators were provided with\nthe question, title, and long answer paragraph from\nNQ divided into sentences using a sentence tok-\nenizer. The annotators had to select the sentences\nrelevant to the answer and then write a concise\nanswer in their own words with \u201ccopy\/pasting\u201d al-\nlowed. The annotators were instructed to write\nthe answer using the selected sentences and that it\nshould make sense, be concise, and grammatically\ncorrect. The question could also be skipped.\nIn Round 2 of the annotation, all answers from\nRound 1 that were made up of two or more selected\nsentences that were not consecutive (meaning there\nwas at least one non-selected sentence between\nthem, see example in Table 1) were annotated a sec-\nond time by a different annotator. These questions\nwere selected as they are more likely to be cohe-\nsive. The annotators saw the answer from the first\nround and could choose to keep the same answer or\nmodify it. Therefore, the second round answers are\nlikely to be of higher quality, however, due to hu-\nman subjectivity both answers could still be good.\nIn some cases, the round 2 annotator skipped the\nquestion and it is also possible that they changed\nthe answer to no longer be non-consecutive.\nThe final CLAPNQ dataset consists of all an-\nswers that have been annotated by more than one\nperson. We provide the annotations from both\nrounds if they were different.\nThe IAA using\nRougeL on the different Round 1 and 2 answers\nis 0.67, indicating the answers are usually similar.\nThe selected sentences, information regarding the\nround, and whether the answer is not contiguous is\nincluded in the dataset.\n3.2\nData Stats\nThe CLAPNQ dataset of 4,946 questions consists\nof both answerable and unanswerable questions as\ndescribed below. The breakdown of the dataset\nis shown in Table 3. We also include the source\nof the questions within the original NQ dataset.\nSince NQ does not release the test set we only\nexplored the train and development sets. Only 67\nNQ dev questions qualified with the properties of\nour task so we use them and additional examples\nfrom NQ train as our test set. While the questions\nand passages are publicly available with NQ, the\nanswers we provide are new. CLAPNQ questions\nhave 1-2 reference answers. The questions are short\nat 9 words and the answers are long at around 57\nwords which is 1\/3 of the average passage length of\n156 words (See Table 2). In addition to the official\ndataset, we will release the round 1 data of 12k\nquestions as training data, referred to as CLAPNQ-\nR1.

In the NQ training set there is only one\nannotation, in the NQ dev set all 5 annotators must\nhave said it was unanswerable. The unanswerable\nquestions were randomly chosen from examples\nthat had more than 5 sentences in the passage by\nmatching the first word distribution of the answer-\nable questions. For example, in CLAPNQ, What\nand Where are the most common question types\nwhile Who is the most common question type for\nthe NQ short answers. Since NQ does not have a\ngold passage for unanswerable questions, a random\npassage is chosen from the Wikipedia document.\n3.3\nRetrieval Corpus\nWe provide a corpus that can be used to build an\nindex for querying CLAPNQ in a retrieval setting.\nIt is built using the passages3 from the original\nWikipedia NQ documents used in the CLAPNQ\ndataset including the answerable and unanswerable\nquestions. In some cases there were slightly dif-\nferent versions of the same document. We only\nkept one in such cases and ensured that there was\nhigh overlap between the differing passages if they\nwere a gold passage to a CLAPNQ question. The\ncorpus includes 178,891 passages from 4,293 doc-\numents, of which 2,345 passages have questions\nassociated with them across the 4,946 train, dev,\nand test answerable and unanswerable splits.4\n3Very long (> 3000 words) and short passages (<15 words)\nthat are not gold answerable passages were discarded.\n4There is usually one gold passage, but 14 questions from the\nNQ dev set have two gold passages. Both are kept in retrieval,\nbut only the more frequent one has a gold answer.\n4\nExperiments and Results\nWe present baseline experiments on CLAPNQ for\nRetrieval, Generation and the full RAG pipeline.\nAn exhaustive implementation of methods and\ntraining setups is beyond the scope of this paper;\nwe provide results to illustrate how CLAPNQ per-\nforms using common and SOTA approaches.\nWe report the commonly used retrieval metrics\nof nDCG@10 and Recall@10 for retrieval. We\nreport several metrics to illustrate generation per-\nformance. Each of our metrics correlate with one of\nthe CLAPNQ properties described in the introduc-\ntion. The first two are the commonly used RougeL\nand Recall (this is the same as Rouge1). RougeL\ncan be considered a good approximation for how\ncohesive the answer is as it will give more credit to\nlonger spans. Recall is a good approximation for\ncompleteness. We also provide RougeLp which is\nan extractiveness metric that measures how faithful\nthe response is. It computes the RougeL of the\nanswer to the passage. Since CLAPNQ is extrac-\ntive, we would expect a good system to have a high\nRougeLp. In addition, we also provide the length\n(in characters) of the answer. We notice that length\nis a strong indicator of how well a model performs\nwith answers that are close to the reference length\nbeing desirable, it is therefore a good approximat-\ning for how concise the answer is.

We also com-\npare to a full passage baseline. The generation task\nis sent to the model using a prompt. Most models\nuse an NQ prompt taken from FLAN-T5 (Chung\net al., 2022). GPT and Llama have prompts based\non their model suggestions, all prompts are pro-\nvided in Appendix B. In our zero-shot setup the\nmodels were provided with the question, context,\nand prompt. In the 1-shot setup (1\/0) the model\nwas provided with the same answerable example\nfrom CLAPNQ training and in the 2-shot setup\n(1\/1) the model was also provided with the same\nunanswerable question for the same passage.

The FLAN-T5\nmodels, which are fine-tuned on short extractive\ntasks, like to provide short answers and therefore\nhave poor Recall.

The SOTA LLMs have poor unan-\nswerable performance but better recall. They do\nnot like to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\" and almost always\nprovide an answer. This is evident with all models\nbut worst with Mistral and GPT 4. Interestingly,\nGPT 3.5 performed better than GPT 4, particularly\nfor unanswerable. The LLMs tend to provide an-\nswers that are far too long, particularly for GPT 4\nat an average of 759 \/797 characters, and therefore\nare not concise. This is apparent from the high Re-\ncall but low RougeL. The low RougeLp indicates\nthat the answers may not be faithful to the passage.\nFine Tuned Encoder Decoder Model. We use\nFLAN-T5-Large for our fine-tuned (FT) experi-\nment, which we call CLAPNQ-T5-LG (See imple-\nmentation details in Appendix C). CLAPNQ-T5-\nLG has good unanswerable performance and good\nrecall. It is clear that the answers are concise and it\nlearns the appropriate answer length. It is closest to\nthe average length of the reference responses which\nis 272 dev and 300 test characters. RougeL and\nRecall highlight that the answers are most cohesive\nand complete and RougeLp shows that it learns\nto extract the answer from the passage, while the\nother models are considerably less extractive.\nWe also explore a smaller training size to help\nmeasure whether performance can be improved\nwhen a small amount of labeled data is available.\nThis is an important use case because labeling data\nin a new domain is costly. We call this experi-\nment CLAPNQ-T5-LG-200 as it was trained using\n200 examples (an equal amount of answerable and\nunanswerable questions) with 10 random samples\nand report the average. The RougeL and unan-\nswerable metrics are better than the SOTA Decoder\nLLMs, but worse than training on the full dataset.\nThe model tends to say unanswerable too much.\nFull Passage Baseline. We compare to a base-\nline where the entire passage is taken as the answer.\nThis performs very well in the automated metrics\nbut it is clearly not concise as indicated by the\nlength. The RougeL score highlights the differ-\nence of the LLMs to CLAPNQ-T5-LG which are\nconsiderably lower than providing the full passage.\nThe difference between the average length of the\ngenerated answers, the reference answer, and the\npassage length are an indicator of how difficult the\nextraction task is. The answer must discard two\nthirds of the passage to be appropriately concise.\n4.3\nFull RAG Pipeline\nIn our full RAG pipeline experiments we retrieve\nthe top passages using the best performing retrieval\nmodel, E5-base-v2, and then perform generation\non the same prompts as in Section 4.2, however in-\nstead of the gold passage, the top retrieved passages\nare included in the prompt. It is possible that the\ngold passage will not be in the top N passages mak-\ning the question unanswerable based on retrieval.\nThe RAG task is far more difficult than the GOLD\ngeneration task as the model needs to learn which\npassages are irrelevant to the question. We experi-\nmented with including the top 3 and top 5 passages\n","question":"Question: What is the average length of the reference responses in the dev and test characters?","answer":"Answer: 272 dev and 300 test characters."}
{"context":"in the prompt. Based on the retrieval results in\nTable 4, 5 documents has a 4 point improvement\nover 3 documents. However, in our experiments\nincluding 5 passages in the prompt increased the\nnoise and did not provide an improvement.\nIn the RAG experiments we explored each dense\nretriever with CLAPNQ-T5-LG, and the best re-\ntriever on the dev set, E5 Base, with the best per-\nforming generation models: GPT 3.5, Mistral-7b-\nInstruct and CLAPNQ-T5-LG. Results are shown\nin Table 6 and we compare against the best GOLD\ngeneration baselines for each model from Table 5 to\nshow the gap for RAG. GOLD can be considered as\nan upper bound as we would not expect the retriever\nto perform better than having only the grounded\npassage for the automated metrics. In all cases per-\nformance drops considerably for CLAPNQ-T5-LG\nwith a very large drop in % unanswerable. Per-\nformance is also reduced for zero-shot GPT 3.5\nand Mistral but not as much as CLAPNQ-T5-LG.\nA human evaluation and discussion that compares\nRAG to Gold is in Sections 5 and 6.\nWe also explored two fine-tuned models that in-\ncorporated RAG during training. They follow the\nsame approach as CLAPNQ-T5-LG, but instead\nof the gold passage, the top 3 retrieval passages\nare included during training. In the second version,\nE5-G-CLAPNQ-T5-LG we ensure the gold pas-\nsage is kept in the top 3 passages during training,\nat a randomly chosen position, even if it was not\noriginally included. These models perform better\non the unanswerable questions than CLAPNQ-\nT5-LG but much worse on the answerable ques-\ntions. The RougeL score of E5-G-CLAPNQ-T5-\nLG (51.6\/52.1) on the answerable questions that\nwere answered is better than CLAPNQ-T5-LG\n(46.7\/44.5) for the dev and test sets, but only a\nlittle more than half the answerable questions were\nanswered. We leave further experimentation on\noptimizing these models as future work.\n5\nHuman Evaluation\nIn addition to reporting automated metrics we also\nperformed a human evaluation on the GOLD and\nRAG setups to explore how appropriate and faith-\nful users think the responses are as used in the\nliterature (Es et al., 2023). For each question and\nanswer, we asked three annotators to indicate on\na scale of 1 (No) - 4 (Yes) whether the answer\nlooks appropriate (i.e. looks correct or answer rel-\nevance) and whether it is faithful to the passage.\nModel Faithful Approp F+A Win-Rate\nGold\nCLAPNQ-T5-LG\n3.7\n3.7\n3.7\n66%\nGPT 3.5\n3.3\n3.6\n3.4\n34%\nReference\n3.9\n3.8\n3.8\n57%\nRAG\nCLAPNQ-T5-LG\n3.8\n3.2\n3.4\n42%\nGPT 3.5\n3.0\n3.6\n3.2\n35%\nReference\n3.0\n3.5\n3.0\n33%\nTable 7: Human Evaluation metrics on Faithful (F)\nand Appropriate (A) on a 4-point scale and win-\nrate.

During the RAG evaluation we also\nasked the annotators to select which of the top 3\nretrieved passages were relevant to the answering\nthe question. If a question was marked faithful, we\nasked the annotators to select which passages were\nrelevant to the answer. Finally, they performed a\npair-wise comparison of the answers to indicate\npreference to compute win-rate. Ties were accept-\nable but they were asked to do so sparingly. The\nanswers were shown to the annotators randomly\nand they did not know which model produced the\nanswer. Instructions and a task screenshot are in\nAppendix A.\nThe human evaluation was for the GOLD and\nRAG setups. 40 answerable and 10 unanswerable\nquestions, with an equal amount of questions were\nrandomly sampled from both the dev and test sets\nbeing included for each setup. The annotators that\nperformed this task are the same annotators that\nworked on creating the dataset, however these an-\nnotations were done at a later time period. We\ncompare CLAPNQ-T5-LG, GPT 3.5 (The best per-\nforming decoder LLM), and the reference answer.\nThe evaluation is shown in Table 7.\nIn the GOLD setup, agreement was high for ap-\npropriateness (73%), faithfulness (88%), and win-\nrate (86%). The annotators preferred the CLAPNQ-\nT5-LG answers the most and GPT 3.5 answers\nthe least.

{"context":"answers. The human evaluation shows that a model\ncan successfully learn to generate faithful and ap-\npropriate responses, but the SOTA LLM models\ndon\u2019t perform as well on this task.\nIn the RAG setup, agreement was very high for\nfaithfulness (91%) and win-rate (90%) but much\nlower for appropriateness (68%). The annotators\npreferred the CLAPNQ-T5-LG answers the most\nwith little difference in preference between the\nreference and GPT 3.5 answers. The CLAPNQ-\nT5-LG answers were very faithful while GPT 3.5\nand the reference were less faithful. The GPT\n3.5 and reference answers were more appropriate\nwhile CLAPNQ-T5-LG was least appropriate. The\nchanges from the GOLD setup highlight the impor-\ntance of evaluating the RAG pipeline. The refer-\nence answers may not be in the retrieved passages\neven though they are correct. However, being faith-\nful to the passages can provide an inappropriate\nanswer if the retrieved passages are not relevant to\nthe question. According to two or more annotators,\n26\/40 answerable questions had multiple relevant\npassages and 4\/40 had no relevant passages. 38,\n39 and 32 of CLAPNQ-T5-LG, GPT 3.5 and refer-\nence responses were considered faithful to one or\nmore passages. 50% of the unanswerable questions\nhad relevant passages.\n6\nDiscussion\nIn this section we describe some challenges we\u2019ve\nencountered. We describe them here and provide\nexamples in Appendix D.\nUnanswerable Questions: While it is unlikely\nthat the unanswerable questions have an answer in\nthe randomly picked passage, we find that in some\ncases, there is actually an answer (Appendix D,\nTable 8). There are other cases where the answer\nto an unanswerable question may appear correct\nwhen looking at the passage, but the passage may\nnot be relevant (Appendix D, Table 9).\nGeneration: GPT 3.5 and Mistral will have an-\nswers that are correct but not faithful to the passage\n(Appendix D, Table 10,11). Since the prompts\nrequest that the answer use the passage, such an an-\nswer should not be provided, or the response should\nexplain that the answer was found elsewhere. In\nmany cases GPT 3.5 and Mistral give an answer\nthat is considerably longer than CLAPNQ-T5-LG\nand the reference (Appendix D, Table 12). The\nrecall is high, but the answer is not concise and\nhas extra irrelevant information. During the human\nevaluation the annotators tend to prefer the concise\nanswers and will often mark long answers as less\nappropriate.\nRAG: The answers can change considerably\ndue to the multiple passages in RAG compared to\nGOLD (Appendix D, Table 13, 14,15). In the RAG\nsetting the automated metrics are much lower than\nthe GOLD setting. However, the answers may be\ngood but just have different information which was\nfound only in the provided passages (Appendix D,\nTable 13). If irrelevant passages are retrieved, (Ap-\npendix D, Table 16), the reference answer will have\nlow extractiveness, but the other answers may still\nbe incorrect while being grounded which is difficult\nto identify without human evaluation.\n7\nFuture Directions\nThe automated evaluation, human evaluation and\ndiscussion highlight several areas of future direc-\ntions: 1) Unanswerable Questions: Many of the\nLLMs struggle with the unanswerable questions\nand often try to provide an answer. 2) Concise An-\nswers: Many of the LLMs like to provide very long\nanswers that are not concise, which is not preferred\nby humans. 3) Irrelevant Retrieval: The models\nwill try to answer RAG questions even when the\npassages are irrelevant, either by being unfaithful\nor incorrect. 4) Multiple correct answers: It is\nharder to evaluate RAG correctly because the an-\nswers could be correct but different than the gold.\n5) Dataset Enhancements: We hope to add more\ngrounded reference answers, a multilingual version,\nand other domains.\n8\nConclusion\nWe have presented CLAPNQ, a new benchmark\ndataset for evaluating the full RAG pipeline.\nCLAPNQ has the properties of being concise,\ncomplete, cohesive, faithful to the passage and\nunanswerable questions.\nA FT model can per-\nform well when the correct passages are pro-\nvided during retrieval, while SOTA LLMs are be-\nhind in faithfulness, conciseness and unanswer-\nability.

Additionally, the U.S. was concerned about Japan\u2019s growing\neconomic dominance in the region, particularly in the China market, which had previously been dominated by\nthe U.S. and other European powers.

The U.S. embargo on oil and other resources was a response to Japan\u2019s aggression\nin China and its refusal to withdraw its troops from that region.
